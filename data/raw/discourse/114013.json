No matter what I do it uses first blank as\n\nan enter and chops the the name off after the “~1”.\n\nI’ve seen other examples where chr(34) was used but it was for vb.\n\n\nprint “xxxxxxxx”\n\nfname = “~1  10 3.35 x 4.55.stl”\n\ncommand = “-_import \" + “’” + rs.WorkingFolder() + “\\” + “stones” + ‘\\’ + fname + “’” + \" -_enter”\n\nprint \"My current directory is : \" + command\n\nrs.Command(command)",
