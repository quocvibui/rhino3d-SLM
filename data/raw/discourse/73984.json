  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI ran into an issue where I could not purge some usertext entries with python rhinoscript\n\nspecifically these type of entries:\n\n\n\n\nIn userdata.py the method GetDocumentUserText pointed to the cause, apparently there was a need to filter escape characters for reasons unknown to me:\n\nI\n\n\n    #todo: leaky abstraction: \"\\\\\" logic should be inside doc.Strings implementation\n    keys = [scriptcontext.doc.Strings.GetKey(i) for i in range(scriptcontext.doc.Strings.Count) if not \"\\\\\" in scriptcontext.doc.Strings.GetKey(i)]\n\n\n\nI’d like to purge the document form all userdata and want do it like so:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport scriptcontext as sc\n\nkeys = [sc.doc.Strings.GetKey(i) for i in range(sc.doc.Strings.Count)]\nfor key in keys:\n    rs.SetDocumentUserText(str(key),'')\n\n\n\nIt clears all entries including those with the escape-characters.\n\nHowever given the comment in the python method, \nI’d like to know if and what danger there lies in not filtering out keys with escape characters.\n\n\nThanks\n\n-Willem",
