  "question": "If I run the following:\n\n\nrs.GetObjects(\"Select a polysurface\",rs.filter.polysurface)\n\n\nit will also select a single surface object.  The mechanism is clear, in selection.py we have:\n\n\n\n\nType 16 is a polysurface - but the filter accepts any brep, including a single face.\n\n\nThis is NOT the case with VB Rhinoscript, a type 16 \nexcludes\n single faced breps.\n\n\nCurrently, if I want to filter correctly for a polysurface, I need to add a custom filter:\n\n\ndef real_ps_filt(rhino_object, geometry, component_index):\n    if geometry.Faces.Count>1: return True\n\nrs.GetObjects(\"Select a polysurface\",rs.filter.polysurface,custom_filter=real_ps_filt)\n\n\n\nMethinks this needs ‘adjustment’…",
