  "title": "Sorting point cloud by its RGB colour range in grasshopper",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nI am trying to create a script (having very little knowledge of grasshopper) with a photogrammetry scan. Based off of the RGB values of each point I want to 1. group them and 2. modify and change their colours.\n\n\nIf someone could help with the script or point me in the direction of where to look that would be amazing!\n\n\nThanks in advance",
