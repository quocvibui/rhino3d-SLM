  "question": "format_\n1226×952 52.1 KB\n\n\nWhen using an external IDE like Pycharm, I can see on the output that there is always an extra item as first item but only happens on Python3 component (RED).\n\n\nIt doesn’t show you on script editor (BLUE) even thought i am just using the same code from a single source.\n\n\nIt also doesn’t show on ootb editor (ORANGE).\n\n\nNow, here’s the weird part, if i extract the script parameter on Script Editor (BLUE) and plug it in on the first one (RED) that first item disappear. Not sure what the IDE does to do that.\n\n\nsample code in pycharm:\n\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\n\nORIGIN = start_pt\n\nX = ORIGIN.X\nY = ORIGIN.Y\nZ = ORIGIN.Z\n\nend_pt = rg.Point3d(X, Y, 10)\n\n\n\nhere’s the image with extracted parameter\n\n\nformat1_\n1306×952 54.5 KB\n\n\nI can get away with just using the script editor, but I just want to know, thanks!\n\n\nI’m using this build\n\n\nRhino Build\n807×677 22.5 KB",
