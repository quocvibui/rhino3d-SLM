  "question": "Hi!\n\n\nI’m currently working on a project that has to do with generating blocks based on the number of blocks around them. I have a working script that generates the first state randomly giving values of 1 (on) or 0 (off) for each point on a grid so that the rest of the script can react to it using the logic that I insert (Kind of like cellular automata if you know what that is).\n\n\nAnyways, now instead of randomly generating the first form, I want to be able to start out with a geometry that I manually put into rhino, and then have the logic work from there.\n\n\ncurrently I have something like this\n\n\nobj = rs.GetObjects (\"select objects\")\n\ndef SelectedObjects (xDimension, yDimension, zDimension, obj):\n   arrStates = []\n   for i in range (0, xDimension):\n     for j in range (0, yDimension):\n       for k in range (0, zDimension):\n         for v in (obj):\n           centroid = rs.CurveAreaCentroid (v)\n           if centroid:\n            print centroid\n\nobj = rs.GetObjects (\"select objects\")\nxDimension = 5\nyDimension = 5\nzDimension = 5\n\n\n\nSorry if this doesn’t make sense. But what I want the script to do is spit out a list of centroids for each object in the list so that eventually I can say something like:\n\n\nif centroid == 1\n  arrv.append (1)\n\n\n\nand do that for the other values i,j,k. This all leads up to eventually having logic like:\n\n\nif vals[i][j][k] == 1\n  (draw a cube here)\n\n\n\nafter this the logic for the rest of the script \nshould\n work.\n\n\nBut from what I currently have I’m not getting anything… no bugs, no text, nothing.\n\nI assume I have some text misplaced but I’m not sure where… I’m kind of new to python.",
