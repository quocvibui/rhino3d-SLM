  "title": "[Python] Adjust size of existing, active floating viewport",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI have been unable to find the correct python call to adjust the size of an existing, active floating viewport. Essentially, I need the equivalent of:\n\n\nrhinoscriptsyntax.Command (\"-viewportProperties _Size 400 200 Enter\" )\n\n… but without the Command() call\n\n\nHere’s what I have, which appears to change the view buffer size, but not the floating window size:\n\n\nactiveViewport = doc.Views.ActiveView.ActiveViewport\ndims = System.Drawing.Size( 400, 200 )\nactiveViewport.Size = dims\n\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",
