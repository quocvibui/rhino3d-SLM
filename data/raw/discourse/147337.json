  "title": "Construct or copy DataTree in Python",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nI have formerly mostly written in C# when working in Grasshopper, but now sometimes have to write parts in Python too, and struggling a bit with this IronPython adaption.\n\n\nWhen construction a empty DataTree in Python, I know I can write;\n\n\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg \nimport Grasshopper as gh\n\npoint_tree = gh.DataTree[rg.Point3d]()\n\n\n\nHowever, I now like to use another constructor for DataTree, the one that takes a DataTree as input to create a shallow duplicate. My first guess was to write it as below, but it do not work;\n\n\npoint_tree = gh.DataTree[rg.Point3d](other_tree)\n\n\nSo how do I access the other constructors of DataTree? I would really appreciate some help with the syntax here, because there’s obviously something I am not getting. Or, is there another way to copy a tree?",
