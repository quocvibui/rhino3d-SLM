  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nI have several surfaces I have to split with curves within a grasshopper python component.\n\nI think I have managed to split them and the result are breps. However, I need these breps inside the component to be surfaces/polysurfaces (I can’t output them and use a different component) but I don’t know how to convert them via script. Possibly due to my limited knowledge of Rhino Common.\n\n\nSee image and script below, should describe better what I am trying to do. Any ideas?\n\n\nThanks you so much in advance\n\n\n\n\nsurfaces contains all surfaces to be split (guids)\n\n\ncuttercurves contains all curves used to split the surfaces (guids)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncut_surfaces_breps = [  ]\n\nfor surface in surfaces:\n\n\n        cutter_elements = [rs.coercecurve(curve) for curve in cuttercurves]\n        brep = rs.coercebrep(surface)\n        split_brep = brep.Faces[0].Split(cutter_elements, 0.01)\n        cut_surfaces_breps.append(split_brep)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow do I convert all cut_surfaces_breps to surfaces?\n\n\n\n\nThe image belows shows cute_surfaces_breps, but I need this to be as polysurfaces/surfaces within rhino",
