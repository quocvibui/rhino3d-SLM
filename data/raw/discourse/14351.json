  "question": "hi guys!\n\n\ni have a mesh-surface and want it to have more respectively less segments.\n\ni made this mesh in a specific way cause it is a study project, and i had to use this scripts.\n\n\nbut i dont know how i can make the surface more/less segment with 2 parameters for the 2 directions.\n\n\ni am looking for the shortest way to do that cause i should not change the scripts to much.\n\nhere 2 pictures for better understanding:\n\n\n \n\n\nand my python script:\n\n\n33.gh\n (13.1 KB)\n\n\nhopefully greets",
