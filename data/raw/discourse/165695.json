  "title": "How to split a brep with multiple surfaces",
  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nI’m trying to split this singular brep with multiple surfaces which have been constructed on a series of planes. From my limited understanding the \nsplit brep multiple\n component should resolve this. However, it doesn’t seem to be working in this particular scenario unless I convert the surfaces into breps by adding a thickness. The problem with that is it isn’t what I want to do as it adds small surfaces between the larger ones.\n\n\nimage\n3461×1295 467 KB\n\n\nimage\n1920×1102 63.2 KB\n\n\n2023-09-16\n1920×800 93.9 KB\n\n\nHere is the script working with the surfaces converted to breps but adds extra surfaces which is not the result I wanted.\n\n\nimage\n1920×1138 70.1 KB\n\n\n2023-09-16 (2)\n1920×800 103 KB\n\n\nGH script: \nBalustrade_Design_230916_help.gh\n (48.0 KB)\n\n\nThank you for your help in advanced!",
