  "question": "Hi there,\n\n\nI was trying to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nblock = rs.AddBlock([obj], pt, str(obj), False)\n\nrs.InsertBlock(block, pt)\n\n\n\n\nwhere pt is the base point I want to keep, but the result always uses the Origin as the base point for blockinstance, and the inserted block will not be at the same place as the original object.\n\n\nIs this a known bug or am I missing something? I am working on (7.5.21100.3001, 2021-04-10).\n\n\nBest,\n\nVincent",
