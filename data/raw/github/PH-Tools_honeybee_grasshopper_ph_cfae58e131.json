On some larger projects with many rooms, creating these duplicate 'People' \nobjects may not be ideal, and may lead to longer run-times. As an alternative, use the 'Set People \nPH Attributes' component to create a Honeybee-Energy Program, which can then be assigned to multiple rooms at once.\n-\nFor Phius residential projects, a room's \"_num_people\" should be the rooms's \"number-of-bedrooms\" + 1\n-\nEM January 28, 2025\n    Args:\n        _num_bedrooms: (list[int]) A list of number of bedrooms for EACH Honeybee-Room input.\n            This should ideally be the same length as the '_hb_rooms' input, and in the same \n            order. If only a single value is input, that value will get applied to all of the \n            Honeybee-Rooms input.
