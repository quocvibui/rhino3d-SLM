  "title": "Multiple data stream into ghpython component",
  "question": "I’m working with a set of closed ranges in grasshopper that I need to feed into a ghpython component. However, it appears that having multiple connections into a single input for the python component causes it to ignore any other connections. (Basically in python I would be working with a list of lists). Does the grasshopper python component only allow single objects to be fed into the component (thus I would need multiple outlets?)\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2018-02-26 15.47.12.png\n1198×796 89.3 KB",
