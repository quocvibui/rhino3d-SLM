  "question": "Hi everybody,\n\nI’m trying to “bake a curve” from Grasshopper to Rhino with ghPython. But I’m surprised not to find any function in python to transfer an ordinary curve from gh context to rhino context.\n\nI would have used something like “rs.AddCurve(curve)” but arguments are points and degree for this function.\n\nDoes anybody knows a way to achieve this?\n\nThank you",
