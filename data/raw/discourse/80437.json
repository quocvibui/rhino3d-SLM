  "question": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI am working with multiple models on the same file composed of many individual parts.\n\n\nI was wondering if there was a way to automatically generate an individual bounding box for each selected group. And by this I mean the higher level group, as sometimes there can be a group within a group.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nShynn",
