  "title": "[SOLVED]Grasshopper + GHpython create lines, based on relations between set of points",
  "question": "I’m working on this file for my senior project at architecture school I have set of points where every point represent specific space and another set that determines the relationship between the spaces using (0,1) I tried to use GHpython to check if there is a relation or no and if it is trow drow a line between the two points that represent these spaces. I think I did it right but the GHpython component is not giving me the set of lines and I don’t know why I tried different methods and no one has worked for me this my code please help me to find what is the problem?\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs \n\ni=0 \nj=0\nk=N\nstart=0\nend=0\n\ncurves=[]\n\nwhile i<=N:\n    if relations [i] == 1:\n        start=  points[i/k]\n        end= points [i%N]\n        curves = rs.AddLine (start,end)\n        i=i+1\n    else:\n        i=i+1\na=curves",
