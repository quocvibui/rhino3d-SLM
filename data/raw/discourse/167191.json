  "question": "Could anyone help me to understand why all of the X points are being returned as \nOutside\n the closed curve?\n\n\nimage\n2176×884 13.6 KB\n\n\nbad-containment.3dm\n (63.9 KB)\n\n\nThis has me stumped - I am using the ClosedCurve Point Containment test method\n\n\nhttps://developer.rhino3d.com/api/rhinocommon/rhino.geometry.curve/contains\n\n\nI am calling it with \nPlane.WorldXY\n and tolerance of 0.001 (I also tried 1)\n\n\nI suspect the complex polycurve is the cause of the problem but its real CNC geometry. I tried to SimplyfyCrv (no effect) and i have checked there are no short curves.\n\n\nIf I test points along a line at other places within the outer curve it returns Inside.",
