  "question": "Hi,\n\nI guess this might be kind of stupid question, but I was not able to solve it.\n\nI am creating Breps with Rhino Common in Python.\n\nSo far that works.\n\nWhen I try to get them back into the rhinoscriptsyntax I am having trouble to get the GUIDs back.\n\n\nThis is what I got: <Rhino.Geometry.Brep object at 0x0000000000002FA2 [Rhino.Geometry.Brep]>\n\nAny help or hints to the right documents are highly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks\n\nT.",
