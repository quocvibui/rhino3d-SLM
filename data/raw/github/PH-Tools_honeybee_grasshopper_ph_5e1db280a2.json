The PHPP is *NOT* part of the \n    honeybee-ph plugin and must be purchased from PHI or your local reseller. For more \n    information, see: \"https://passivehouse.com/04_phpp/04_phpp.htm\"\n    - The PHPP document you would like to write to should be open alongside Rhino, \n    and must be the the 'active' excel document. To ensure best results and least \n    likelihood of conflicts, it is recommended to close all other excel documents \n    on your system except the PHPP.\n    - Once the PHPP file is open, set _write to True to run the writer. \n    - IMPORTANT: This component simply writes the data to the PHPP file. Once writen, \n    be sure to save your PHPP file with the new data to the appropriate location on \n    your computer.\n-\nEM October 2, 2022\n    Args:\n        _hbjson_file: (str) The full file path to the HBJSON you would like to write \n            out to PHPP.\n        \n        _activate_variants: (bool) Default=\"False\", Set True if you would like to \n            connect all of the various PHPP inputs to the 'Variants' worksheet.
