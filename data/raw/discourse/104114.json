  "question": "Hi guys, I am very new at this, so I don’t know how to do pretty basic things.\n\nHow would I be able to mesh a sphere using a GHPython script?\n\n\nI made the sphere using Rhino.Geometry, and below is what I have so far:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\n\n\npt = rg.Point3d(0,0,0)\n\nc = rg.Sphere(pt, 12)\na = c\n\n\n\nThanks!!",
