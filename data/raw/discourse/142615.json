  "question": "@dale\n\n\nI was wondering if I could ask you regarding some sample code you posted back in 2018 that might be obsolete or changed.\n\n\nhttps://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinoscript/replacing-points-with-blocks/\n\n\nHere you specify how to insert a block instance into the document.\n\nI can’t find a method called \nInsertBlock\n in the RhinoCommon API.\n\n\nI basically have some blocks defined in the BlockManager and I want to place them around in my model with some transformations and attributes.\n\n\nDo you have any information that can help?\n\nThanks",
