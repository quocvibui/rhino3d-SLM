  "title": "Parallel Computing ghpython vs Tasks",
  "question": "Hello guys,\n\n\nI’m trying to compare the difference in parallel computing between ghpythonlib and System.Threading.Tasks.\n\n\nHowever, I encountered a problem that the Tasks method didn’t give me a correct result (sequences are messed up). And I assume it’s because I wrote the function in the wrong way.\n\n\nThere is my code:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nfrom System.Threading import Tasks\n\n\nlist = []\n\ndef math(y):\n    \n    value = y+1\n    \n    list.append(value)\n\n\nTasks.Parallel.ForEach(x,math)\na = list\n\n\n\n\n\nCapture\n1132×431 32.5 KB\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone can help me to take a look, I’ll be really appreciated\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nParallelTest2.gh\n (11.0 KB)",
