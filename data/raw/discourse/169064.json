  "title": "SelVisible in Grasshopper?",
  "question": "Hi there !\n\nDoes anyone know if there is any way to implement “SelVisible” in grasshopper with Python?\n\n\nI want to filter the geometries by the visibility (obscured by other geometries or not in a viewport).\n\nI found the RhinoCommon API “Rhino.Display.RhinoVieport.IsVisible(point3d)”.\n\nBut it is not a function I want. It works only to detect whether a point is in a view frustum…\n\nI want to distinguish or detect whether an object is hidden(obscred) by other objects in a specific viewport or in an active viewport.\n\n\nThank you so much for sharing your knowledge !",
