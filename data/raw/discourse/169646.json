  "title": "Cannot load \"RhinoLibrary\" DLL from Python using rhinoinside",
  "question": "Hi all, I’m trying to load the RhinoCommon API to use for Python scripts at a Flask API endpoint; however, when I try to start the Flask API locally, I get the “Unable to load DLL ‘RhinoLibrary’: The specified module could not be found.” error. I have rhinoinside, rhino3dm, and the ghhopsserver installed already. I’ve verified that the DLLs are in my Rhino folder path and that I can load RhinoCommon.\n\n\nIs there a known solution for this problem or alternatively, is there any way to directly reference the RhinoCommon API as a library similar to rhino3dm or rhinocompute? I would use those libraries instead but they do not offer all the methods/property access as the RhinoCommon API and would require me to refactor all my code.\n\n\nHere’s my code:\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nfolder = Path()\n\n\nimport rhinoinside\n\nrhinoinside.load(str(folder))\n\nimport System\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\n\nimport Rhino.Runtime as rr\n\nimport Rhino.FileIO as rf\n\n\nI’ve tried both specifying and not specifying a folder path. Thanks!",
