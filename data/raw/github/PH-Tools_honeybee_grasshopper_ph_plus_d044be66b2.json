This will provide a warning if the ratio of \nmesh-faces / mesh-vertices is above the threshold (default=1.5), which is a marker of suspect geometry. \nUse the 'check_shades_' output to visualize the suspect shades. Often is is easiest to \nsimplty re-drawn the shade geometry in Rhino more cleanly to resolve these meshing issues.\n- \nNote that not all shades flagged here will cause a failure or problem. This merely means that the \nmeshes have many faces, and may increase the computation time and file sizes in later operations. \nThis is especially true if you are visualizing these meshes outside Rhino. Try to keep your shade \ngeometry as simple as can be and keep the meshes as clean as possible to improve performance.\n-\nEM May 29, 2024\n    Args:\n        _shades: (List[Shade]) A list of the Honeybee Shades to check the meshes of. \n\n        _threshold: (float) default=1.5 | The ratio of faces::vertices of the resultant\n            mesh which indicates that it should be checked and could probably be cleaned up.\n            \n    Returns:\n        check_shades_: A list of the suspect shade meshes.
