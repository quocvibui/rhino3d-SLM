  "title": "Rhino GH Python output seems wrong",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI wrote this primitive script in GH Python component to make a set of curves:\n\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\n\n# Create a plane in the horizontal direction\nplane = rg.Plane.WorldXY\ncurves = []\n\nfor i in range(1, irange):\n    # Offset the curve in the horizontal plane\n    offset_curve = curve.Offset(plane, -i*0.1, 0.01, rg.CurveOffsetCornerStyle.Round)\n    \n    curves.append(offset_curve)\na = curves\nprint(curves)\n\n\n\nProblem is that it outputs this instead of geometry:\n\n\nimage\n735×572 52.6 KB\n\n\nWhen I set the output to “a = offset_curve” it does output a curve. I have found an \nexample\n where a list of curves is handled the same and it works fine so I don´t know what is wrong.\n\n\nThank you for your time",
