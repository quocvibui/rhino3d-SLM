  "title": "Edit control points by rhino common",
  "question": "Hi guys, I have some problems when I want to edit curve’s control points by python.\n\n\nI search ‘control point’ or ‘grips’ in rhino common API, and I found one property called ‘GripsOn’, but that is in Rhino.DosObjects. I apply this to the curve I generated by Rhino.Geometry, it will report error and ask for a RhinoObject. I am confused about these now, what’s differennt of those namespaces? Which one I should choose? And how I can edit the control point of a curve of surface?",
