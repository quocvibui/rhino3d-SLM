  "question": "Hello. I’m currently trying to use Python to create some steps leading up to a building. So far, I am able to create each individual step as the number of steps increases but it only outputs the final step. For example, when trying to generate 2 steps, it’ll only output the second step and not include the first step\n\nwith it. I’ve tried putting the steps in a list so it will output the previous steps as the number of them increases but I can’t figure out how to do so. Could I get some guidance please?\n\n\nPython scripting.gh\n (6.3 KB)",
