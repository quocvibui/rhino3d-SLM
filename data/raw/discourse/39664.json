  "title": "How to use MeshMachine or Kangaroo from Grasshopper within Rhino Python scripts?",
  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nI need to remesh more or less uniformly a mesh from inside a Python scripts running in Rhino. I already installed Grasshopper and the Kangaroo0099 version of Kangaroo (I was not sure the version 2 and up had MeshMachine in them?)\n\nI seem to be able to write this import:\n\n\n\n\nimport ghpythonlib.components.MeshMachine as ghmm\n\n\n\n\nbut I don’t know how to create the MeshMachine object or how to feed it its parameters.  I saw people calling Rhino from GrassHopper but can we do the other way around?  If so, how?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nBruno",
