  "title": "How to Access Object Details within Rhinoscript or Python Script",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\nI’m trying to write a script that is able to see and output part of the object details that are shown when I click the “Details” button in the properties tab.  I’m specifically looking for it to output the object description from the geometry section.  The goal of the script is to quickly see whether a bunch of arcs are NURBS arcs or standard arcs.  This is helpful for me to know when exporting to DXF.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJosh",
