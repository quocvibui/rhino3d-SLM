Equipment Residential values (MEL and Lighting). The results of this\ncomponent should match the Phius Multifamily Calculator.\nNote also that for this to work properly, each dwelling unit (apt) should be its own Honeybee-Room.\n-\nThe resulting elec_equipment_ objects can be added to the Honeybee-Rooms by using a \"Add PH Equipment\"\ncomponent and passing them to the 'equipment_' inputs. Note that this component will only calcuate the values\nin the Phius Multifamily Workbook. These include MEL, Interior-Lighting, Exterior-Lighting, and Garage-Lighting.\nThis does NOT include the other residential appliances (fridge, cooking, etc..). Be sure to add those\nto the Residential Honeybee-Rooms in addition to the elec_equipment_ created by this component.\n-\nEM January 22, 2025\n\n    Args:\n        int_light_HE_frac_: (float) default=1.0 | The % (0-1.0) of interior lighting\n            that is 'high efficiency'\n\n        ext_light_HE_frac_: (float) default=1.0 default=1.0 | The % (0-1.0) of exterior\n            lighting that is 'high efficiency'\n\n        garage_light_HE_frac_: (float) default=1.0 | The % (0-1.0) of garage lighting\n            that is 'high efficiency'\n\n        include_garage_: (bool) Default=False.
