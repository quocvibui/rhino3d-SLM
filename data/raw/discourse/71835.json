  "question": "As the topic mentioned i have no Idea what a  Array[Brep] is and how it can be converted to a brep object.\n\n\nIf a\n\n\n\n\nRhino.Geometry.Brep.CreatePlanarBreps\n\n\n\n\nis created the result is  Array[Brep] but in my case its only a single flat surface. No brep methods seams to work.\n\n\nSome Tips how to work with this kind of object would be great.",
