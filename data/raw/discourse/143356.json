  "question": "Hi, I am trying to adapt this script so that it will run in GH. I am having trouble defining the output for the small circles and also not sure how to define the variable input B so that I can divide radius by any number rather than 2.\n\nI include the script that works well, directly from python and the script I have used in GH.\n\n\n\n\ncirclesoncircles\n1920×1250 165 KB\n\n\n\n\nSo far I have only had success with output “a” showing up in Rhino from GH",
