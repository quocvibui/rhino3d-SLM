  "question": "Hey guys,\n\n\nI have a set of floors that are beeing generated from a file that I have created. However, so far the highest floor had to become the roof manually. I would like to develop a gh snippet which automatically checks the floors by their height, takes the one at the top and changes its layer.\n\n\nDo you guys have an idea on how to do that? I fear this must be done in Python\n\n\nWould appreciate any help.\n\n\n\n\nBildschirmfoto 2022-11-16 um 11.02.08\n1920×1277 91.2 KB\n\n\n\n\nfloortoroof.gh\n (10.0 KB)\n\n\n\n\nBildschirmfoto 2022-11-16 um 11.02.34\n2364×616 158 KB\n\n\n\n\nfloortoroof.3dm\n (4.0 MB)\n\n\nBest\n\nMax",
