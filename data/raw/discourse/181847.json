  "question": "hello\n\n\ni need to rotate a list of surfaces ( stripes ) around a given list of axes and according to a corresponding list of angles\n\n\nthe starting position is for instance this\n\n\nimage\n994×476 20.1 KB\n\n\nthe list angles is for example this\n\n\n\n\npoint is that i want to make it in a recursive manner meaning that the first angle applyes to all stripes while the second to all stripes minus the first and so on, the result i need is this\n\n\nimage\n956×424 19.3 KB\n\n\nI have very limited experience with python and limited time for studying  and i am not  able to achieve the result\n\n\nif anybody can help me and show me how to solve it i’d appreciate.\n\n\ncheers\n\n\n20240511 STRIPES ROTATION.3dm\n (110.6 KB)\n\n\n20240511 STRIPES ROTATION.gh\n (9.5 KB)",
