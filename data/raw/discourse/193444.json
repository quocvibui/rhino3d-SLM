  "title": "How to set parameter as optional in Python 3 component",
  "question": "I have written some custom script components using the new Python 3 component. In the  \ninstructions\n it is shown that such components can be published directly or with contextual inputs connected to it.\n\nI cannot use the contextual inputs as i need a domain input which is not possible with the selection of contextual inputs. Further i would prefer all my components to be contained within one Grasshopper definition for easier development. Therefore I am not using them.\n\n\nPublishing the plugin works fine and i can use the components. However the components do not execute without all inputs populated. How do I change this? Will there be a parameter manager for the python modules?",
