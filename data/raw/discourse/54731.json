  "title": "Iteration over non-sequence of type Brep for rs.CopyObject",
  "question": "I am writing simple script to multiply the zones to specified height (z-axis) specified times.\n\nI get error \nRuntime error (TypeErrorException): iteration over non-sequence of type Brep\n at rs.CopyObject is executed. Since I don’t expect iteration happens at this code, I have no idea what is wrong. Can anyone tell me the reason? Below is the code.\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\ndef floorMultiplier(zone,height,number):\n    building=[zone]\n    for i in range(1,number+1):\n        print (i)\n        print (type(zone))\n        temp=rs.CopyObject(zone,[0,0,height*i]) <=I get error at this point\n        building.append(temp)         \n    return building\n   \nAllZones=floorMultiplier(TypicalFloor,FloorHeight,FloorNumber)",
