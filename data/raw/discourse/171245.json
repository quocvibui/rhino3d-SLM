  "question": "This is probably a simple question, but i´m new to RhinoCommon.\n\nI want to create a new surface from points or curves. I know there is a method NurbsSurface.CreateFromPoints() but only accepts 4 points, what if the shape have more than 4 points?\n\nAnd other thing, ¿is there a paper or whitepaper with an explanation of the internal geometry structure in Rhino, that would be really helpffull for newcomers to not waste time trying and error…",
