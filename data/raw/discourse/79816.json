  "title": "Handy Tips for GHPython Editor/Component (Rhino 6)",
  "question": "Perhaps it will be helpful to have an “unofficial” list of things/tips, that might help answer some of the “re-occurring” questions that come up on the forum, (in regards to ghpython).\n\nThis isn’t intended to be any sort of comprehensive guide, but more of a  running list of things that folks might find useful to know when working, (or starting to learn to work), with a ghpython component.\n\nMost of these have come from the generous minds of this forum.\n\nFeel free to post other handy tips/suggestions! (or corrections!)\n\n\n\n\nMust Read links:\n\n1 - \nRhino - Rhino.Python Guides\n\n2 - \nRhino - An Overview of the GhPython Editor\n\n3 - \nRhino - GhPython Common Questions and Answers\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to familarize yourself with this secition \n\"What is “ghdoc” and how does it relate to the rhinoscriptsyntax?\n , in the link above. You can save yourself a bit of “GUID” headache by sticking exclusively with Rhinocommon. With that said…opinions on Rhinocommon vs rhinoscriptsyntax may vary.\n\n\n\n\n4 - \nCompile GHPython Component Tutuorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations:\n\nYou can’t use numpy/scipy.  This is an ironpython limitation, not specifically a ghpython limitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding additional component interface options:\n\nIt’s probably best to NOT go down the path of trying to add certain types of component interface options, (buttons for example).  read more here:\n\n\nButton and Context Menu discussion\n\n\nYou absolutely can add additional context menu items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Editor tips:\n\nhighlight line/s and \ntab\n will indent multiple lines\n\nhighlight line/s and \nshift+tab\n will unindent highlighted lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Documentation, hints, and things to know:\n\nAutocomplete may not always return all the information you may be looking for.  Get used to using the RhinoCommon API documentation\n\n\nhttps://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/R_Project_RhinoCommon.htm#\n!\n\n\nthe objects that come up in the autocomplete, (intellisense), of an imported module, will have icons that indicate what they are.\n\n\n  = property...",
