  "title": "How to get a surface of a filleted rectangle via RhinoCommon?",
  "question": "Actually, I’d like to build a flat rectangular surface with all corners filleted to the same radius. What would be the proper way to achieve this? While reviewing the Surface class, I couldn’t find a fillet option. Perhaps I should first fillet the polyline (rectangle) and then create the surface from it, but I’m not sure how to do that. Can someone help me?\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-08-04 at 10.31.13 AM\n1562×1092 6.81 KB",
