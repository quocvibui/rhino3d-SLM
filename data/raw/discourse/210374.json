  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nWe were currently developing our plugin using version 8.18.\n\nWhen we updated to 8.23, the rhinocommon.dll gets copied into the build folder of the plugin inspite of setting CopyLocal Property to False.\n\n\nTo fix this we have currently written a post-build event to remove the dll.\n\nBut earlier this copy never occured.\n\n\nAny insights on this?\n\n\n@dale\n \n@stevebaer",
