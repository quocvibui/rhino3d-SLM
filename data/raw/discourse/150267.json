  "title": "Rhino Python Editor: No module named Grasshopper",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nMy Rhino Python Editor can no longer import the Grasshopper module.\n\n\nI wrote a little script (script A) that opens grasshopper files from Python.\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Grasshopper as gh\nimport os\n\ndocName = rs.DocumentName()\ndocPath = rs.DocumentPath()\n\nghPath = docPath + docName[:docName.rfind(\".\")] + \".gh\"\n\nif os.path.exists(ghPath):\n    print \"Opening associated GH file \", ghPath\n    gh_scriptinterface = gh.Plugin.GH_RhinoScriptInterface()\n    gh_scriptinterface.OpenDocument(ghPath)\n\n\n\nIt was working just fine until, I tried to run script A from a subprocess while opening a 3DM file, something like the below (script B)\n\n\ncallScript = '\"{0}\" \"{2}\" /nosplash /runscript=\"{1}\"'.format(rhinoPath, scriptCall, fileName)\nsubprocess.call(callScript)\n\n\n\nNow my Rhino python editor cannot import Grasshopper at all. I get the following error message:\n\n\n\n\nI restarted my computer and the issue persists. ‘import Grasshopper’ was working perfectly fine until I tried to launch script A from another subprocess, now it is unrecognized.\n\n\nHow do I fix this?",
