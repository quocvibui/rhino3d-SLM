  "question": "I would like to run a script which at one point will stop and let the user manipulate the grips of a simple line.\n\nOnce done, user hits enter, and the script will calculate the resulting length of the line.\n\n\nI assume that i need to use the Rhino library for this, i can’t find anything within rhinoscriptsyntax.",

    {
      "code": "import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nline = rs.GetObject(\"select line\")\nprint (\"line length=\" + str(rs.CurveLength (line)))\nrs.EnableObjectGrips (line, enable=True)\ngrips = rs.GetObjectGrips(\"Select curve grips\")\n#now i need the gumball on\nprint (\"new line length=\" + str(rs.CurveLength (line)))",
