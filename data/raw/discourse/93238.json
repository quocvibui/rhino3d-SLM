  "title": "Connecting Curves to Random Points Loop",
  "question": "Hey, so I’m very much a beginner when it comes to python scripting, and I’m trying to create a loop for a grid of points where I can created curves that will be randomly generated between these points. I got the grid to work, but I’m currently testing with just lines and I can’t seem to get the lines to connect to these points randomly, here’s the current script:\n\n\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nimport random\n\n\nxvalues = range(40)\n\nyvalues = range(5,30,1)\n\npoints = \n\nfor i in xvalues:\n\nfor j in yvalues:\n\npoint = rs.AddPoint(i,j,0)\n\npoints.append(point)\n\n\nnewPointsx = \n\nfor i in range(20):\n\nnewPointx = random.choice(points)\n\nnewPointsx.append(newPointx)\n\nnewPointsy = \n\nfor j in range(20):\n\nnewPointy = random.choice(points)\n\nnewPointsy.append(newPointy)\n\n\nrs.AddLine(newPointsx,newPointsy)\n\n\n\n\nI could be writing this completely wrong, so any help and guidance would be appreciated.",
