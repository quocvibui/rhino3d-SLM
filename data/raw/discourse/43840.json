  "title": "Splitting a closed curve in two places not at start/end",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nI can’t figure out how to do this in Python/Rhinocommon - I have a closed 4 segment curve which I need to split in two places, neither of which is the curve start/end point.  I can use ClosestPoint() to get the curve params and then use Curve.Split(params) to split the curve, but I end up with 3 segments…  Is there an easy way to get the segments around the start/end point to join back together?  (The normal Rhino Split(Point) command does this).  I tried jumping through a few hoops, but nothing works reliably, must be missing something obvious here…\n\n\nThanks, --Mitch\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n1348×403 6.98 KB",
