  "title": "rhinoscriptsyntax.SplitBrep problem in Rhino6",
  "question": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to make a script written in Rhino5 to work in Rhino6. I have encountered a problem with the SplitBrep function. I am trying to split a polysurface (Superquadric sphere) using another surface (plane). The two objects clearly intersect, however the function returns None.\n\n\nHere is the script:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nHalfSQ=rs.GetObject('Select Superquadratic') \nprint rs.IsBrep(HalfSQ)\nCutPlane1=rs.GetObject('Select cutting plane')\nprint rs.IsBrep(CutPlane1)\nresult = rs.SplitBrep(HalfSQ,CutPlane1)\n\n\n\nBoth print lines return true and the variable result is None at the end of the script. This code worked in Rhino 5. If anyone had a same problem or might have an idea why this does not work please let me know.\n\n\nIf any clarifications are needed please ask, I’m new to the forum.\n\n\nThank you for your help",
