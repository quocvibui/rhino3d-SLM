  "question": "Hi all I am running into an issue pickling a custom class which contains Rhino Guid objects in Rhino 8 in combination with python 3.\n\n\nBelow is the minimal code example (this does not contain my custom class but gives the same behaviour)… which results in the following error:\n\n\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'Guid' object\n\n\n\nCode example:\n\n\n#! python3\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport pickle\n\npt = rs.AddPoint((0,0,0))\na = pickle.dumps(pt)\n\n\n\nConverting the GUID to a string before pickling works, but is there a way to maintain the Guid class in pickling?\n\n\nThe same code in Rhino 7 and IronPython (using cPickle module) works without errors, and the Guid type is maintained:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport cPickle as pickle\n\npt = rs.AddPoint((0,0,0))\na = pickle.dumps(pt)",
