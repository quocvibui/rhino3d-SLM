  "question": "I need to be able to set the clippingplane to the cplane and clipp what is “towards” me, but I can not set the “x-direction” to a negative value, can you add this please?\n\nOr a “FlipClippingPlane” would do.\n\n\nBy default a clipping plane is pointing towards the user, and that is in the counter-intuitive direction IMO.",
