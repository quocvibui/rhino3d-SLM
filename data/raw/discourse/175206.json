  "title": "Collapse / Dissolve crv shorter than \"X\"",
  "question": "Hello everyone \n\n\nI have a closed curve and I would like to automatically dissolve all crvs if they are shorter than “X”.\n\nThis is my attempt but I got stuck. Can someone help me? Is my attempt even a good approach?\n\n\nMy idea is:\n\n\n\n\nto get the vertices of the all crvs\n\nreplace the vertices of the short crv(s) with a single midpoint\n\nconnect all vertices / points to a closed crv again\n\n\n\n\nBut I dont know how to remove the endpoints of the short crv from an overall list of all vertices of the closed crv.\n\nI’ll send the file if you want to take a look for yourself.\n\n\nRhino Dissolve Crv\n701×671 30.8 KB\n\n\nDissolve crv shorter than x.3dm\n (60.1 KB)\n\n\nDissolve Crv.gh\n (7.7 KB)\n\n\nRhino GH Dissolve Crv\n1138×522 42.1 KB\n\n\nThank you for helping!",
