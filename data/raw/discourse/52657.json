  "title": "Minor complaint on Python/RhinoCommon samples (developer.rhino3d.com)",
  "question": "I see this in many of the samples:\n\n\nfrom Rhino import *\nfrom Rhino.Geometry import *\nfrom Rhino.Commands import *\nfrom Rhino.Display import *\n\n\n\netc.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this often does not help us easily understand what classes/methods are being used as they are no longer explicitly spelled out, especially if there are several * as above, it’s harder to find the methods in the script and to understand to which classes they belong.\n\n\nImporting everything with a \n*\n is fine in common practice and makes for less typing when you know what you are doing, but explicitly laying out the whole method “chain” is far better for people trying to learn and understand what the sample is all about…\n\n\nJust my opinion of course…  thanks for listening!\n\n\n–Mitch",
