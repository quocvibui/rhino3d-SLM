  "question": "Hi guys\n\n\nJust installed RH8 and played around with it, but I am having a problem to get the auto-complete / hints after either Rhino.Geometry or rhinoscriptsyntax commands.\n\nIn RH6 and 7 it’s super convenient the hint showing automatically after a parenthese “(”. when editing the script while it doesn’t work on my laptop with RH8 in Grasshopper.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I got it in Rhino’s python editor without any issue. I attached 2 screen shots as reference and would be super grateful if anyone knows how to fix it!\n\n\nps. Really appreciate the editor now has dark mode and more comprehensive user interface, thanks McNeel team!\n\n\nrh8_GHpythonEditor\n1258×819 58.4 KB\n\n\nrh8_pythonEditor\n1083×822 29.1 KB",
