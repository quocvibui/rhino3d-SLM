  "question": "Could someone explain to me how can I specify which data I want to provide if the method accepts a number of types as inputs?\n\n\nLike this for example:\n\n\n\n\nI remember seeing somewhere something like:\n\n\nPoint3d[0](x,y,z)\n# or\nPoint3d[2](somePointObject)\n\n\n\nBut it doesn’t work like that.\n\n\nMany thanks in advance.",
