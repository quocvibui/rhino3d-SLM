  "title": "Philosophy and options for using Rhino without a GUI",
  "question": "Currently, we are using Rhino to manipulate toolpaths and the related curves, and points.  We have Rhino running in the background and send it commands via shared memory.  All of this is done with Python.  This solution works great but there are some limitations, and I would like to know what my options are for using Rhino without the normal user interface.\n\n\nFor example, can I use:\n\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport scriptcontext as sc\n\n\n\nfrom any Python program?  Do I still have layers to organize?  What features do I have with the normal GUI that will go away?\n\n\nMy goal is NOT to hide Rhino, but if I can use the functions inside a Qt thread then I will be able to send signals through the Qt (officially PySide) application.  I cannot do that with the current architecture.\n\n\nWhat options, if any, do I have?\n\n\nThanks for your suggestions.",
