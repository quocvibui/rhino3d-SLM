  "question": "Hi, I’m very new into scripting with Python and scripting overall.\n\nWhen you call a function in Grasshopper Python Script Editor like:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nrs.LineClosestPoint(\n\n\n\nyou get like information about the input the function needs in the help panel of the editor.\n\nI asked myself if it is possible to script these informations for your own definitions you create in your script. Like:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\na = 0\n\ndef test(x):\n    x = x+1\n    return(x)\n\na = test(a)\nprint a\n\n\n\nI wish that when you call the def test( you get some advices in the help panel for the required input.\n\nHope somebody understands what i’m trying to say \n and can help me with this.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\ngrafik\n537×649 17.2 KB",
