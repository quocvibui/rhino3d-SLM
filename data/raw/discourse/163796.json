  "title": "Mesh CreateFromCurveExtrusion bug",
  "question": "Given a flat closed curve, I want to extrude it in the upwards z direction. Given the dimensions of the boundingbox, I would expect the curve to extrude only in the positive z direction. However, the \nrg.Mesh.CreateFromCurveExtrusion\n seems to extrude in the negative direction as well (negative z extrusion distance always seems to be -1, even if I change my vector length). Hereby you find a Python example:\n\n\nvector = rg.Vector3d(0,0,1)\nparams = rg.MeshingParameters.QualityRenderMesh\nbbox = rg.BoundingBox(0,0,0,100,100,10)\n\nmesh = rg.Mesh.CreateFromCurveExtrusion(curve, vector, params, bbox)\n\n\n\nAttached a small internalized example:\n\n\nexample.gh\n (3.8 KB)\n\n\nimage\n957×642 107 KB",
