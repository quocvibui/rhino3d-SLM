  "title": "Setting different sizes on mesh edges in ghpython",
  "question": "Hi guys!\n\n\nHere are pictures of the meshes I am working with:\n\n\ncompletemesh\n512×745 52.9 KB\n \nMesh-q\n830×637 147 KB\n\n\nI originally had 1 mesh object, but with my current code I duplicated it and set the second mesh object within the first one. Here is my code so far:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\nimport ghpythonlib.components as gh\n\nmesh = rg.Mesh.Offset(input_mesh, .3, False)\nlist = rg.Mesh.GetNakedEdges(mesh)\n\n\n\nI was wondering if it possible to set the different edges of the interior mesh to different sizes (opposed to all of them being .3mm). and then the mesh would smoothly transition in size from one edge to the next? As you can see from the first pic, there are 3 edges, so it could get tricky. I am having trouble finding anything.\n\n\nThanks!!\n\n\nThanks",
