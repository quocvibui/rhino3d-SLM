A new output branch will\nbe created for each set of hb-objects at that level. Use the '_tolerance' input \nto adjust if the groupings are not correct at first.\n-\nEM January 25, 2024\n    Args:\n        _hb_objects: (List) A List of HB-Objects (Rooms, Apertures) to sort by their Z-Height\n        \n        _tolerance: (float) Default=0.001\n        \n        _groups_: (Optional[int]) If a target number of groups is provided, will attempt\n            to split the objects into that many groups.\n        \n        _steps: (Optional[DataTree[Domain]): Enter the 'steps' as domains (ie: \"0 To 3\", etc..)\n            and the component will attempt to sort to objects into the specified steps. This \n            is especially useful if attemptinto sort 2 sets of objects with different bounds (\n            (for instance, sorting a group of HB Rooms and a group of HB Apertures into the same\n            groups). The 'steps_' output from one component can be input into a second in order \n            ensure that the groups maintain the same 'splitting' levels.\n        \n    Returns:\n        hb_apertures_: (DataTree[Aperture]) The HB-Apertures, sorted by height.\n        \n        steps_: (DataTre[Domain]): The 'steps' used to group the HB-Objects. This output \n            can be input into another 'HBPH - Sort HB Objects by Level' if you are trying \n            to filtter two sets of objects into similar groups.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Rhino as rh\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport ghpythonlib.components as ghc\nimport Grasshopper as gh\n\nfrom honeybee_ph_rhino import gh_io\nfrom honeybee_ph_plus_rhino import gh_compo_io\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport honeybee_ph_plus_rhino._component_info_\nreload(honeybee_ph_plus_rhino._component_info_)\nghenv.Component.Name = \"HBPH+ - Sort HB Objects by Level\"\nDEV = honeybee_ph_plus_rhino._component_info_.set_component_params(ghenv, dev=False)\nif DEV:\n    from honeybee_ph_plus_rhino.gh_compo_io import util_sort_hb_objects_by_level as gh_compo_io\n    reload(gh_compo_io)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# -- GH Interface\nIGH = gh_io.IGH( ghdoc, ghenv, sc, rh, rs, ghc, gh )\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ngh_compo_interface = gh_compo_io.GHCompo_SortHbObjectsByLevel(\n    IGH,\n    _hb_objects,\n    _tolerance,\n    _groups,\n    _steps,\n    )\nhb_objects_, steps_ = gh_compo_interface.run()",
