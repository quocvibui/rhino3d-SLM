  "title": "C# script in ScriptEditor does not run in debugging mode with breakpoints",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI hope I am missing something very basic here.\n\n\nIn testing out some of my C# scripts in the Rhino 8 (8 SR15) ScriptEditor I have come across the following.\n\n\nThe following very simple example code runs fine when the green arrow or F5 is pressed in the script editor.\n\n\n// #! csharp\nusing System;\nusing Rhino;\n\npublic class Test\n{\n    public static void TestMethod()\n    {\n        RhinoApp.WriteLine(\"This is a test\");        \n    }\n}\n\nTest.TestMethod();\n\n\n\nHowever, when a breakpoint is added (to the line \nRhinoApp.WriteLine(\"This is a test\");\n) for example, the following error is returned.\n\n\n\n\nCompile Error\n\nKeyword ‘this’ is not valid in a static property, static method, or static field initializer (Error CS0026)\n\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, this makes it a lot more challenging to debug code.\n\n\nI welcome suggestions as to how I can debug Rhino C# code with breakpoints in the script editor. I know I can also debug with breakpoints step by step in Visual Studio, but then I need to reload Rhino with every time I run the plugin. Script editor provides a nice intermediate step to get smaller blocks of code working before putting them into a full blown plugin.\n\n\nMany thanks for your help,\n\nAllan",
