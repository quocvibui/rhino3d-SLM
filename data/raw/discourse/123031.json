  "question": "Hello, i’m wondering if anyone can help me with this. I’m a beginner with gh and python.\n\nI’m trying to recreate the Spectral Grove pavilion from SoftLab with GHpython, and I don’t really know where to start. I created the circles in grasshopper (but maybe there’s an easier way to do it in python?)\n\nI’ve broken down the process into, what I think, would be the 4 steps to start from\n\n\n\n\ncreate circles (6)\n\n\ndivide circles (23, 18, 14, 22, 24, 16)\n\n\ncreate curve bewteen base circle and top circle\n\n\ncreate straight lines\n\nI don’t really know how to go on from step 2, once I’ve created the circles and divide them. Not really sure how to begin in python too.\n\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nghpython Spectral grove.gh\n (78.3 KB)\n\n\n05-17-2020-2000001\n800×536 143 KB\n \nsketch1\n1121×769 37.6 KB\n \n5457fd5af70f7b5c18f308f545a716aa\n615×410 61.2 KB",
