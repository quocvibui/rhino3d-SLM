  "title": "How to select wire frame items only at Z = 0",
  "question": "I have extracted a wire frame from a 3d model, and I want to select only the wire frame items which are at Z:0 and discard the other items below that, and I’m wondering if this is possible? ( or the other option is select the items below Z:0 and delete them )\n\n\nI have tried just going to a front view and drawing a selection square for the items below Z:0 and deleting these items hoping to leave just the items at Z:0 and this works fairly well, but there are still some items that are just slightly below the Z:0 that are hard to pick using this process.\n\n\nI’m using this process to create and export a selection group that will be used for my CNC Cam tool paths\n\n\nThank You…\n\n\nKent",
