  "title": "Unable to find assembly 'RhinoCommon'",
  "question": "Hi, I have install Rhino 7 and PyCharm. In a Conda environment with python 3.8 I pip install rhinoinside and import it. However, when I exectute rhinoinside.load() I get the following error:\n\n\nclr.AddReference(\"RhinoCommon\")\nSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException: Unable to find assembly 'RhinoCommon'.\n   at Python.Runtime.CLRModule.AddReference(String name)\n\n\n\nIf I send in the path to the Rhino system folder to rhinoinside.load(rhino_dir) it works. However, this should not be necessary and I would like to resolve the issue rather than working around it. Actually, I had the problem a couple of years ago as well, but I cannot remember how I managed to solve it. Anyone who have experienced this and have a solution?",
