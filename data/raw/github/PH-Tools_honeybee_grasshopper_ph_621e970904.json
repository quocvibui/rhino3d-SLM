This is required in order to properly calculate\nthe Phius occupancy, lighting, and electrical equipment usage. \n-\nIf you are creating a single-family home, simply input all of your rooms\nto this component. If you are creating a multi-unit (apartment) building, split up your rooms onto separate \nbranches as appropriate. All of the Rooms on a single Branch will be set to the same 'dwelling'.\n-\nEM January 31, 2025\n    Args:\n\n        _num_dwellings_: (DataTree[int]) Default=1. Optional input for the number of dwellings \n            for the input hb-room. This is useful if you are doing multi-unit residential projects\n            and are modeling HB-Rooms as 'blocks' or groups of dwellings in order to simplify \n            the overall model geometry. In this case, input a DataTree with values that match the \n            order of the HB-Rooms input. If you are modeling a single-family project, or each \n            HB-Room maps to a single dwelling, then leave this input blank.\n\n        _hb_rooms: (DataTree[Room]) The HB-Rooms to set as a 'dwelling'\n            \n    Returns:\n        hb_rooms_: (DataTree[Room]) The HB-Rooms with their 'dwelling' set.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Rhino as rh\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport ghpythonlib.components as ghc\nimport Grasshopper as gh\n\n\ntry:\n    from honeybee_ph_utils import preview\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    raise ImportError('\\nFailed to import honeybee_ph_utils:\\n\\t{}'.format(e))\n\ntry:\n    from honeybee_ph_rhino import gh_compo_io\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    raise ImportError('\\nFailed to import honeybee_ph_rhino:\\n\\t{}'.format(e))\n\ntry:\n    from ph_gh_component_io import gh_io\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    raise ImportError('\\nFailed to import ph_gh_component_io:\\n\\t{}'.format(e))\n\n\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_\nreload(honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_)\nghenv.Component.Name = \"HBPH - Set Dwelling\"\nDEV = honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_.set_component_params(ghenv, dev=False)\nif DEV:\n    from honeybee_ph_rhino.gh_compo_io.program import set_dwelling as gh_compo_io\n    reload(gh_compo_io)\n    reload(gh_io)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# -- GH Interface\nIGH = gh_io.IGH( ghdoc, ghenv, sc, rh, rs, ghc, gh )\n\n\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ngh_compo_interface = gh_compo_io.GHCompo_SetDwelling(\n        IGH,\n        _num_dwellings_,\n        _hb_rooms,\n    )\nhb_rooms_ = gh_compo_interface.run()",
