  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nDoes anyone know what PointCloudKNeighhors returns?  It’s supposed to be an array of integers, which I was hoping were the index numbers from the point cloud.\n\n\nHowever, I have no idea what to do with the thing it returns.\n\n\nIf there are any Python Wizards out there that can give me a couple of pointers, I would be most grateful!\n\n\nAsh",
