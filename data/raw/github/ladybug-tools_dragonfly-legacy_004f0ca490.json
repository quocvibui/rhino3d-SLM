The specific characteristcs of these typologies are based on the US Department of Energy (DoE) Building types.\n-\nProvided by Dragonfly 0.0.03\n    Args:\n        _geo: A list of closed breps that represent the geometry of the buildings in the urban area that fall under this typology.\n        _program: One of the 16 building programs listed from the \"DF Bldg Programs\" component.  The following options are available:\n            FullServiceRestaurant\n            Hospital\n            LargeHotel\n            LargeOffice\n            MediumOffice\n            MidRiseApartment\n            OutPatient\n            PrimarySchool\n            QuickServiceRestaurant\n            SecondarySchool\n            SmallHotel\n            SmallOffice\n            StandAloneRetail\n            StripMall\n            SuperMarket\n            Warehouse\n        _age: An integer that sets the age of the buildings represented by this typology.  This is used to determine what constructions make up the walls, roofs, and windows based on international building codes over the last several decades.  Choose from the following options:\n            Pre-1980's\n            1980's-Present\n            New Construction\n        _flr_to_flr_: A number that sets the average distance between floors for the building typology.  This will be used to compute the total floor area of the building, which ultimately determines the influence that the typology has on the urban microclimate.\n        _fract_canyon_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the fraction of the building's waste heat from air conditioning that gets rejected into the urban canyon (as opposed to through rooftop equipment or into a ground source loop).  The default is set to 0.5.\n        _run: Set to \"True\" to run the component and generate a building typology.\n    Returns:\n        read_me: ...\n        typology: A Dragonfly building typology object that can be plugged into the \"DF City\" component.\n        -------------: ...\n        footprints: The building geometry as projected onto the world XY plane.  This is used to determine the site coverage ratio and to perform a weighted-average of the building heights.\n        floors: A list of breps representing the floors of the typology.\n        facades: A list of breps representing the exposed facade area of the building breps.  These will be used to calculate the facade-to-site ratio.\n\"\"\"\n\nghenv.Component.Name = \"DF Building Typology\"\nghenv.Component.NickName = 'BldgTypology'\nghenv.Component.Message = 'VER 0.0.03\\nMAR_25_2020'\nghenv.Component.Category = \"DF-Legacy\"\nghenv.Component.SubCategory = \"1 | Urban Weather\"\n#compatibleDFVersion = VER 0.0.02\\nMAY_12_2018\nghenv.Component.AdditionalHelpFromDocStrings = \"2\"\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Grasshopper.Kernel as gh\n\n#Dragonfly check.\ninit_check = True\nif not sc.sticky.has_key('dragonfly_release') == True:\n    init_check = False\n    print \"You should first let Drafgonfly fly...\"\n    ghenv.Component.AddRuntimeMessage(gh.GH_RuntimeMessageLevel.Warning, \"You should first let Drafgonfly fly...\")\nelse:\n    if not sc.sticky['dragonfly_release'].isCompatible(ghenv.Component): init_check = False\n    if sc.sticky['dragonfly_release'].isInputMissing(ghenv.Component): init_check = False\n    df_BuildingTypology = sc.sticky[\"dragonfly_BuildingTypology\"]\n\nif init_check == True and _run == True:\n    typology, footprints, floors, facades = df_BuildingTypology.from_geometry(_geo, \n        _program, _age, _flr_to_flr_, _fract_canyon_)",
