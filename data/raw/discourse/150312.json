  "question": "Hello all,\n\ncould you please help me?\n\nI’m trying to create a ramp that consists of different tiles. Part of the assignment is to integrate python code. Lately I have succeeded to create a 3D surface of the ramp from a list of curves.\n\n\nI can’t seem to do an extrusion of curves. Can anyone help?\n\nThanks~!\n\n\nnew grasshopperwithcode!.GH\n (24.1 KB)\n\n\nBK3OV3 DIAGRAM_25.10_a.3dm\n (10.2 MB)\n\n\n\n\nimage\n1152×2048 198 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n832×470 87.3 KB\n\n\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\nout = []\na = []\nfor crv in crvs:\n    print(crv)\n    templist = []\n    templist.append(crv)\n    patch = rg.Brep.CreatePatch(templist,None,0.1)\n    print(patch)\n    a.append(patch)\n    vector = rg.Vector3d(0, 0, 400)\n    Extr = rg.Extrusion.Create(crv, 4000, False)\n    out. append(Extr)",
