  "title": "Load/Register GH_Param from .dll",
  "question": "Is there a way to manually add custom GH_Param types to the component server that are not contained in a .gha?\n\n\nI have several grasshopper plugins, and I want them to be able to use the same custom params, so the params live in a shared .dll. I have it partially working. I’m able to reference the custom params from components within my plugins. The only issue is that the params do not show up in the toolbar (i.e. you can’t place them on the canvas). Is there a workaround where I can have one of the plugins manually load the params from the shared dll?",
