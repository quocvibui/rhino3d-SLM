  "title": "RhinoApp.Runscript not working in C# script from toolbar",
  "question": "I am trying to use \nRhinoApp.Runscript\n inside a C# script.\n\n\nWhen I hit the ‘Run’ button inside the ScriptEditor, it works perfectly.\n\nHowever I would like to assign the script to a toolbar button, with the macro\n\n\n\n\n-ScriptEditor _run “myscript.cs”\n\n\n\n\nThen the script fails. Probably the command ScriptEditor should be a ScriptRunner command for it to work ?\n\n\nIs there another way to execute a C# script from a toolbar button ?",
