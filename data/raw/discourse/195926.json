  "question": "Is there any way in Grasshopper to uniquely identify parameters or their data? With geometry referenced from Rhino, there is a unique Guid, but what about with Grasshopper made objects?\n\n\nFor example, I have a custom component that accepts one or more curve parameters. Let’s assume that I connect 3 curves created by various ways with vanilla Grasshopper components. If one of the curves changes, I would like to be able to tell which of the 3 curves changed.",
