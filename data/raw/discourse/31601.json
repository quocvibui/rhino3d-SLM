  "question": "Hi @ all,\n\n\ni was wondering how i can define a function or if-statement which is called or proceded when a defined keyboard button (lets say “esc”) is hit?\n\n\nsomething like:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino as rhi\n\nif rhi.RhinoApp.EscapeKeyPressed is True:\n    rs.MessageBox (\"Center point of label was written to labelman_config.txt\", buttons=0, title='Leaving Dialog')\n\n\n\nBut this does not work for me.\n\nWhen I check what this element contains with\n\n\nprint \"%s \\n\"%rhi.RhinoApp.EscapeKeyPressed\n\n\nthis gives me:\n\n\n<IronPython.Runtime.Types.ReflectedEvent+BoundEvent object at 0x0000000000000080 [IronPython.Runtime.Types.ReflectedEvent+BoundEvent]>\n\n\nI dont know how to handle this.\n\n\nThanks a lot for suggestions!\n\n\nKind regards\n\nMr Sinter",
