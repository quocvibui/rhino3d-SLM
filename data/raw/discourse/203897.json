  "question": "I am trying to do what I thought was quite a straightforward thing to do in python: splitting a surface using either curves on it or surfaces perpendicular to it. However the splitbrep seems not to work, not accepting the perpendicular surfaces as breps, but I can’t find any other command to do it.\n\n\nimage\n719×410 76.3 KB\n\n\nsurfaces.3dm\n (84.9 KB)\n\n\nCode was just\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nsrf = rs.GetObject(“srf”, 8 )\n\ncut = rs.GetObjects(“cutting srfs”, 8)\n\nrs.SplitBrep(srf, cut, True)\n\n\nAnyone could please help?",
