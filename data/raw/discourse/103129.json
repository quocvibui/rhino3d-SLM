  "title": "RhinoCommon equivalent to GH Linear Array?",
  "question": "Is there a \nghPython\n equivalent in \nRhinoCommon\n for the Grasshopper Linear Array component (or other Array components)?\n\n\nI currently access the \nLinear Array\n component from Grasshopper using the \nghpythonlib.components.LinearArray\n but I will probably not be able to use this \nNode in Code\n functionality once I refactor the \nPython\n code to \nC#\n. I want to make this original code future proof for the next phase.\n\n\nIf there isn’t a RhinoCommon equivalent, could somebody from McNeel post the definition from Linear Array that I can plug into my Python code using RhinoCommon?\n\n\nThanks.",
