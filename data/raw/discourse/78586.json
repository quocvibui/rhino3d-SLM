  "question": "I use the Unroll component a LOT, and somehow, with this set of surfaces, there is no way I can get it to work.\n\nSince there is no GH Unroll component (Shame on you David !) ,  I use ones from plugins ; namely :\n\n-Fabtools\n\n-Wombat\n\n-Lunchbox\n\n-(None in Pufferfish. Strange…)\n\n\nAlthough some of those surfaces have a (slight) compound curvature , they will unroll fine in Rhino with UnrollSrf.\n\n\nI’m really at loss with this.\n\n\nAll Unrolls Fail.gh\n (887.0 KB)",
