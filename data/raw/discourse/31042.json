  "title": "Python Plugin with Rhino Script Compiler",
  "question": "Dear Community,\n\n\nhello everyone, im very new to python programming and have my first issue \n\ni made a plugin with python (works well in the rhino python editor and works well when i copy the py file in the python plugins folder). now i wanted to generate a plugin to distribute. i took the process through the rhino script compiler, everything works well, afterwards its installing the plugin, but when i start rhino, enter the plugin-command (the plugin name appears, i can click it) but after, nothing is happening.\n\nMaybe you have an idea what it could be or maybe i totally forgot something?\n\n\nthanks a lot for your help. \n\nbest\n\nmichael",
