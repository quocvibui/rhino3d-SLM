  "question": "Is there a way to get a list of the display conduits that are being called? And remove items from the list?\n\n\nThe reason I’d like that is as follows:\n\n\nWe have a plug-in which draws in the viewports using a display conduit. Our plug-in is constantly under development, and… uh, it sometimes crashes. Which leaves the display conduit still running and rendering in Rhino until we fully close Rhino and restart it. Painful if you are iterating developing…\n\n\nWhat I’d like to do, when our plug-in starts, is get a list of the display conduits currently being called. If I find a previous version running, I remove it. That would keep us from having to close and re-open Rhino.\n\n\nAny hope for this? (I know, I know… the answer is don’t let the plug-in crash \n )\n\n\nMark",
