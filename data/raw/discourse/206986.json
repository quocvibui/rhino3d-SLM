  "question": "hi there,\n\n\nI got a segmentation fault using rhino3dm in blender on Ubuntu 24.04 . Tested with blender 4.2 and 4.5\n\nThere is already an issue for import_3dm: \nSegfault when loading model · Issue #140 · jesterKing/import_3dm\n\n\nJust using rhino3dm in blender to load a file has the same result. Using it in python on linux seems to work fine.\n\n\nTest file and script:\n\n\nmesh_plane.3dm\n (19.7 KB)\n\n\nimport rhino3dm\n# adjust file path accordingly\nf = rhino3dm.File3dm.Read(\"mesh_plane.3dm\")\n\n\n\nI came across this while writing test cases for import_3dm.\n\n\n@nathanletwory\n \n@fraguada\n Hope you are the right people to ping. Would be great if one of you could take a look at this.\n\n\nThanks!",
