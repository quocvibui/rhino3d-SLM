  "title": "Custom Object Grips and MoveUVN",
  "question": "I have custom surface grips that work as expected when dragging them interactively, but they don’t respond to most actions in the MoveUVN command; when I click the <> arrows or drag the slider I don’t seem to get any response in the custom grips; normally when I interactively drag the grips the OnDraw override allows me to handle to get the desired behavior; is there another virtual method or event I should be looking for to get MoveUVN behavior in custom grips? Thanks, Larry",
