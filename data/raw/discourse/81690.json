  "title": "Cutting an object with multiple objects - rhinoscriptsyntax",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nI am trying to do what would seem a very simple operation with python but it appears to be more difficult than expected. I have a surface (or multiple surfaces) I have to split with a list of cubes, then I have to assign each of these surfaces to a layer and split them in turn with a list of lines. (see attached image)\n\n\nHowever the rhinoscriptsyntax doesn’t allow for this as it requires to use just to object at the time. I thought I could then use the rs.command but however I can’t manage to select the objects I want to cut my surface with. Below the code I am using\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nsrf = rs.GetObject(\"surface to cut\",8)\ncuttingObjects = rs.GetObjects(\"cutting elements\",16)\n\nrs.SelectObject(srf)\nrs.Command(\"split \")\nrs.SelectObjects(cuttingObjects)\nrs.Command(\" \")\nrs.UnselectAllObjects()\n\n\n\nI tried for example to move the objects I want to cut my surface with and then write “sellast” in the command string, however this doesn’t appear to work.\n\n\nAny way this could be solved?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n1530×695 38 KB",
