  "title": "How to check what .keys exist on Document User Text?",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI am setting document user text via python using a runpythonscript command\n\nsc.doc.Strings.SetString(key, str(value))\n\n\nBut after running a few such commands, how do I check what .keys exist in the Document? As usual .keys are not exposed on the UI.\n\n\nimage\n510×369 7.27 KB\n\n\nThere is no way to plug a document into grasshopper’s user text component (which is what I usually use to see the .keys on model objects). The field expressions component only gives values for keys, it would be nice if I can also retrieve a list of all keys on the Document User Text.",
