  "question": "Hi,\n\nThere is probably a very simple answer to this question:\n\nrs.Command(\"_Arc 0,0,0 0,10,0 10,0,0\")  dont return an arc.\n\n\nI have found out that the last instance (the end point) is for me always reprecenting an angle, and not point as I would prefer.\n\nHow do I change the last instace to point\n\n\nMany thanks in advance",
