  "question": "Hi there,\n\n\nI’m doing my first scripts in ghpython, and want to trim a surface with a curve. In grasshopper I would use the srfsplit item, but haven’t found any equivalent script command. The split brep command looks like it could do the job, but it doesn’t take curves as cutters, only breps. Is there anything I’m missing?\n\n\nThanks",
