  "title": "Serial Write in GhPython, for MIDI",
  "question": "Dear forum,\n\nIs there a way to send MIDI messages from GhPython?\n\nI need to open a serial port and set the baud rate to 31250.\n\nThen I need to send some bytes through that port, for example 0x90 0x3c 0x40\n\nI assume it would be useful with a Serial Library, but how do I install that?\n\nI have tried the Firefly Serial Write, but I can’t get the proper output (some bytes are changed and others are added).\n\nThanks a lot!",
