  "title": "Help with ExtendSrf using python script",
  "question": "Hello everyone,\n\n\nI am currently facing an issue regarding ExtendSrf using python and Rhinocommon.\n\nwhat I want to achieve is simple: select multiple edges of multiple surfaces and extend them all with same distance.\n\n\nI initially wrote an python script to do it but it always untrim the surfaces before extend them, I would like to extend trimmed surfaces as well just like how the command “_ExtendSrf” would do.\n\n\nSo later I tried to first select multiple edges, then directly run command “_ExtendSrf” in python through “rhino.RhinoApp.RunScript”. But no matter what I do, it still asked me to manually select edges to extend.\n\n\nI appreciate any insights or advice you can provide. Thank you in advance for your help!",
