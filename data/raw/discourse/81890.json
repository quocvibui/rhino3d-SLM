  "question": "Hello All,\n\n\nI would like to ask if is possible to loop over a selection of groups?\n\n\nfor group in groups:\n\n…\n\n\nUltimately, I would like to make a script that will first use the contour command (group = yes)\n\nAfterwards to move each group on a different location\n\nFinally use the command setpt and flatten everything\n\n\nThank you in advance!",
