  "question": "12/22:\n\n\nneed ‘Copy’ option in the command line when referencing geometry\n\n\n‘Get Integer’ needs ‘Undo’ option just like ‘Get Number’ component\n\n\n‘Group’ option for ‘Context Bake’ component\n\n\nif numerical input component (like Get Number) has a predefined value,\n\n\nit would be nice to be able to just hit ‘Enter’ to keep that value in the command line\n\n\nunless a different value is desired\n\n\na definition with ‘Solid Difference’ component slows the GHplayer down a lot\n\n\nOtherwise, GHplayer is one of the best features added to a new release! you can now create\n\nyour own custom tools. Superb!",
