  "title": "Python in Grasshopper (guid and geometry)",
  "question": "Dear all,\n\n\nIt’s quite confusing dealing with grasshopper and rhino and switch in between sometimes, so we have some question as below see if there’s someone can explain more:\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the common practice to work with geometry in grasshopper python, use rhinoscriptsyntax? scriptcontext or Rhino Common, or others? is there any strategy for this?\n\n\nWhen dealing with rhinoscriptsyntax, the default python component takes input to be guid. If we give a type hint to the input say “Curve”, then it will become a Rhino Geometry object. How do we convert this Geometry back to Guid in order to use rhinoscriptsyntax?\n\n\n\n\nThanks",
