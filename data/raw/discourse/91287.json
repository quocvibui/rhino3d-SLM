  "question": "Hi, I’m trying to create an interpolate curve through a set points which I also scripted in python.\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nfrom math import*\n\nfor i in range (0,100):\n\nrs.AddPoints([(sin(i)*3),i,(cos(i)*3)])\n\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2019-10-31 at 18.02.29.png\n840×968 55.9 KB\n\n\n\nI tried to referencing these points as\n\npoints = rs.AddPoints([(sin(i)*3),i,(cos(i)*3)])\n\nrs.AddInterpCurve(points, degree=3)\n\n,but it gives me error. How should I fix this?",
