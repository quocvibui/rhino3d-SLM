The second should be a command line instruction for direct use in Rhino's command interface.\n            The actipn to be done is {user_instructions}.\n            For the Python script, provide a function that takes necessary parameters (such as dimensions, location, etc.) as arguments and adds the specified model to the Rhino document. The function should be versatile enough to accommodate different shapes and sizes based on user input.\n            For the Rhino command line, provide a step-by-step sequence of inputs that a user would follow to create the same model using Rhino's built-in commands. The instructions should be clear and easy to adapt to different user-specified parameters.\n            Please ensure that both the Python script and the Rhino command line instructions are detailed, accurate, and easy to customize based on user inputs.\"\"\"\n            # print(prompt_5)\n            messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_5}]\n            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n                model='gpt-4',\n                messages=messages,\n                temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output\n            )\n            print(response.choices[0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n            messages_2 = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_gpt_created}]\n            response_2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n                model='gpt-4',\n                messages=messages_2,\n                temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output\n            )\n            print(\"_______________________________\")\n            print(response_2.choices[0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print('ERROR', e)\n            # print('there')\n            # print('this is an error', e)\n        #   Print the generate`d translation\n    # print('fake response')",
