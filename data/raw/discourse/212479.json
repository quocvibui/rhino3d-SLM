  "title": "Cannot get RhinoScriptSyntax AddEdgeSrf() to work",
  "question": "I cannot get the RhinoScriptSyntax “AddEdgeSrf()” to work on two planar, concentric closed curves.\n\n\nI copied the exact example ( and added the missing parenthese in the if statement) :\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\ncurves = rs.GetObjects(\"Select 2, 3, or 4 curves\", rs.filter.curve)\nif (curves and len(curves)>1 ): rs.AddEdgeSrf(curves)\n\n\n\nNo error messages, but also no surface added.\n\n\nRhino 8 (Version 8  (8.25.25314.11002, 2025-11-10))\n\n\nEdit: AddPlanarSrf() seems to work fine. Am I missing something?",
