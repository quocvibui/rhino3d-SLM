  "title": "Trying to Apply Surface mapping in Rhinocommon",
  "question": "Hello all,\n\nI am trying to apply surface mapping to a surface that it being rebuilt programmatically. The V component is based on a factor of the surfaces width (we have a huge volume of individual models that need parameterized surface mapping).\n\n\n    For Each NewGuid In NewGuidList\n        Dim New_Obj As Rhino.DocObjects.BrepObject = RhinoDoc.ActiveDoc.Objects.Find(NewGuid)\n        Dim Obj_Ref = New DocObjects.ObjRef(NewGuid)\n        Dim Temp_Brep As Brep = Obj_Ref.Brep()\n        Dim Temp_Crv As Curve() = Nothing\n        Dim Temp_Pts As Point3d() = Nothing\n        Intersect.Intersection.BrepSurface(Temp_Brep, IntPlane, doc.ModelAbsoluteTolerance, Temp_Crv, Temp_Pts)\n        Dim Temp_Length As Double = Temp_Crv(0).GetLength\n    Next\n\n\n\nAt this point I have a rebuilt surface, and the length I need.\n\nIn the command menu, what I would put at this point is\n\n_-ApplySurfaceMapping 1 (Temp_Length / 5) 1 _enter\n\n\nI’m hoping that there might be an analogous function in rhinocommon. Also, because of certain restrictions, I am having to work with Rhino5 on this project.\n\n\nThanks for any help!",
