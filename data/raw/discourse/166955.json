  "title": "Uncheck '.BAK' creation via Rhinoscript",
  "question": "When saving to a synched folder form the cloud, the ‘.bak’ file that gets created holds onto the checkout controls rather than the saved file. To get around this, we are making our standard to deselect the “Create backup (*.*BAK) files…” option in Options|Files. I would like to add this enforcement to the script we use to make sure everyone is using the same settings. Is there a way with Rhinocommon/Python/vbscript to change this setting?\n\n\nimage\n1023×503 107 KB",
