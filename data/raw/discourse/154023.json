  "title": "Most effective method to extrude complex 2D pattern to 3D",
  "question": "I have a 2D pattern of a bunch of tiny holes that I would like to extrude into 3D, but because of the number of spots I have, the extrusion takes a long time. I wonder if there’s a more effective method to extruding other than \nextrudecrv\n\n\nAlso, what would be the recommended method if I would like to have a twisted 3D geometry with this pattern? I tried \nflowalongsurface\n, which works, but like extrusions, it takes forever to do.\n\n\nAttached is a portion of the file I would like to make into 3D, there are 17137 closed curves.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n345×904 15.4 KB\n\n\n\n\n2Dpattern.3dm\n (5.3 MB)",
