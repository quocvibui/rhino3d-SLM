  "question": "I cannot find the correct python code to let a group of points rotate around the z-axis of a plane.\n\nDo you might know how I must do it?\n\n\nTransform and translation?\n\nI tried several things, but I think I am doing things incorrect.\n\nHere is a clean version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeveloper.rhino3d.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransform.Rotation Method (Double, Point3d)\n\n\nConstructs a new rotation transformation with specified angle and rotation center.
