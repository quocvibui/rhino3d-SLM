  "question": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nDoes anyone know how to start a new rhino file when I run the script.\n\nso first thing I want the script to do is to create a new file without asking if I want to save the file already open and with no template for the new file.\n\n\nthis is because when I run the script in for testing I always need to open a new file to clear everything (layers, history, etc)\n\n\nthanks so much\n\nFrancisco",
