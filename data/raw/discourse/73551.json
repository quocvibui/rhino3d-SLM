  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI have for long written codes in python for rhino using rhinoscriptsyntax but since I have now to deal with a large number of geometries to be processed I thought that it could improve the speed of the code by using rhino common syntax instead (which I understand would run much faster). Hope the question below is not too stupid!\n\n\nI am trying to select objects (one set from layer and one from selection) get their bounding box and compare them.\n\n\nMy first problem is that I don’t know what is the equivalent of GetObjects and GetObjectsByLayer in rhino common. I tried Rhino.Input.RhinoGet.GetMultipleObjects() but doesn’t seem to work (requires all the inputs?)\n\n\nThe second is that even if I use rhinoscriptsyntax I cannot evaluate the bounding boxes by using Rhino.Geometry.BoundingBox(rs.coercegeometry(objs02[j])) as it is telling me that a Brep is returned while Ienumerable required.\n\n\nSample code below.\n\n\nAny suggestion? In general where would you look if you have to translate a script from rhinoscriptsyntax to rhino library?\n\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nimport Rhino\n\n\nobjs01 = rs.ObjectsByLayer(“1”)\n\nobjs02 = rs.GetObjects()\n\n\nrs.AddLayer(“duplicate”)\n\n\nfor i in range(0,len(objs01)):\n\nfor j in range(0,len(objs02)):\n\n\n    box1 = rs.BoundingBox(objs01[i])\n    box2 = rs.BoundingBox(objs02[j])\n    \n    if box1 == box2:\n        rs.ObjectLayer(objs02[j],\"duplicate\")",
