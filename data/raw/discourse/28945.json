  "title": "Redraw and Layers panel",
  "question": "I have noticed that the EnableRedraw method will not only redraw the vieports but also seems to be affecting the layers panel. I can see that the selected layer is ‘flickering’ on each redraw. This is distracting and seems to be slowing down the script. I am in a loop with frequent redraw on/off. Would there be any way around this? Is it necessary for redraw to refresh layers panel as well ?\n\n\nthanks,\n\n\n–jarek",
