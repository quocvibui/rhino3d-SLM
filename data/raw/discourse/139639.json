  "question": "Super simple question, but my mind is just not working today, I’m creating a custom ghpython component and want a quick check that what is being input is of type Plane, ie:\n\n\nif type(x) == ‘Plane’:\n\n\nObviously, that code doesn’t return positive even if x is a plane, but for the life of me I can’t figure out what to put for the conditional (after the equal to)?",
