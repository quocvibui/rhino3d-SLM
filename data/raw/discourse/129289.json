  "question": "Greetings, I have a list of mesh vertices IDs and I would like to unweld mesh at those vertices.\n\n\nhttps://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/M_Rhino_Geometry_Mesh_UnweldVertices.htm\n\nSeems like  a perfect solution, except I can’t get it to work.\n\nMy current mesh is completely welded with no creases, if I unweld it it doesn’t change behavior.\n\nI have read the tips for the method and I did TopologyVertices.TopologyVertexIndex() but the provided list has the wrong indexing no matter how I approach it.",
