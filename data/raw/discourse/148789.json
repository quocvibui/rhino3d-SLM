  "title": "Rhino Wip missing lots of Assemblies - System.Drawing, Threading etc",
  "question": "I try to open some simple C# components that work on windows and also on mac v7, but on the WIP version they all throw many errors about missing assemblies?\n\n\nE.g. I can add System.Drawing without errors in the editor, but as soon as i use even the simplest thing like ‘Color’ in the actual code, I get errors about missing assemblies.",
