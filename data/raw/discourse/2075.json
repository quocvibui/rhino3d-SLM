  "question": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to check the way rhinoscriptsyntax MoveObject() method works. When trying to implement it into the Rhino Python Editor, it works with no problem:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\ncurve = rs.GetObject(\"pick up the curve\")\nrs.MoveObject(curve,[10,0,0])\n\n\n\nBut when I try to do the same thing in the GH Python component, like this:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\na = rs.MoveObject(curve,[10,0,0])\n\n\n\n(“curve” is the GH Python’s input plug)\n\nHere is the error message I get:\n\n\n\n\nRuntime error (TypeErrorException): iteration over non-sequence of type NurbsCurve\n\nTraceback:\n\nline 1076, in TransformObjects, “C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\McNeel\\Rhinoceros\\5.0\\Plug-ins\\IronPython (814d908a-e25c-493d-97e9-ee3861957f49)\\settings\\lib\\rhinoscript\\object.py”\n\nline 392, in MoveObjects, “C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\McNeel\\Rhinoceros\\5.0\\Plug-ins\\IronPython (814d908a-e25c-493d-97e9-ee3861957f49)\\settings\\lib\\rhinoscript\\object.py”\n\nline 378, in MoveObject, “C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\McNeel\\Rhinoceros\\5.0\\Plug-ins\\IronPython (814d908a-e25c-493d-97e9-ee3861957f49)\\settings\\lib\\rhinoscript\\object.py”\n\nline 3, in script\n\n\n\n\nWhy is that?\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nP.S.\n\n\nI saw this “Iteration over non-sequence of type NurbsCurve” issue has appeared in two more cases by googling. Two separated users posted a question on this at \nstackoverflow.com\n, but unfortunately I did not understand the answers.",
