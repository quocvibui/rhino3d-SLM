  "title": "Basic question: What is 'Rhino' & 'scriptcontext' when we typing 'import rhino' & 'import scriptcontext'?",
  "question": "Hi guys, I\nm just starting to learn rhino python. Recently i\nve read some python script in the forum, and notice that sometime we need to import rhino and scriptcontext. What are these files? Where could I find  introduction about these 2 files?\n\n\nI only find introduction about importing Rhinoscriptsyntax in this page:\n\n\nhttps://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-introduction/\n\n\nBut nothing about importing rhino and scriptcontex. Is it a must-have before scripting everytime? Or we do it when needed?\n\n\nIf it is a ‘do-when-needed’,then when do we need to import them and what function they have? Could ‘Rhinoscriptsyntax’ replace both/either of them?\n\n\nMany thanks",
