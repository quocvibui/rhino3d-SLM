  "title": "Get group of rhino to grasshopper",
  "question": "I would like to ask if there is any possibility to select groups of objects from rhino canvas and reference them in grasshopper?\n\n\nIn human \n@andheum\n plugin you can reference groups, but is there a way to select group by mouse and reference them? Would it work if I select GUID and group them by some sort of group identifier?\n\n\nMaybe someone has similar example how to do this or a reference to Rhino SDK?",
