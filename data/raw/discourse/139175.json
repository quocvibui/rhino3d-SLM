  "question": "I am currently looking for a quick way to transform Rhino geometry from Grasshopper without referencing and baking.\n\n\nOpenNest’s Transform GUID is basically what I need, but unfortunately they did not expose the \ndelete orignal\n boolean, so you always keep the original.\n\n\nDoes anyone know a quick way of transforming GUID and deleting the original Geometry?\n\n\nMy pseudo code attempt in Python (ps: I don’t really know Python):\n\n\n\"\"\"Provides a scripting component.\n    Inputs:\n        x: List of GUIDs\n        y: List of Transforms\n        z: Bool delete original\n        u: Trigger transform\n    Output:\n        a: The a output variable\"\"\"\n\n__author__ = \"seltz\"\n__version__ = \"2022.03.09\"\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino as rc\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport System.Guid\n\nsc.doc = rc.RhinoDoc.ActiveDoc\n\nif u:\n    for i in x:\n        rhobj = x(i)\n        xform = y(i)\n        delete = z\n        sc.doc.Objects.Transform(rhobj, xform, delete)\n        sc.doc.Views.Redraw()\n\n\n\nThis post also seems relevant: \nCurious: Faster to Transform then delete rather than Transform with delete true\n\n\nHere is what I want to do:\n\n\nSet any number of “floor objects”, set any number of geometries placed above the floor, transform the objects so they sit directly on the floor objects:\n\n\n\n\nCanvas at 11;17;12\n1442×693 76.2 KB\n\n\n\n\nground_object.3dm\n (183.5 KB)\n\n\nground_object.gh\n (27.7 KB)\n\n\nThanks!",
