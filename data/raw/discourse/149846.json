  "question": "Hello \n@dale\n,\n\n\nI’m trying to get this def to work in GH, but it doesn’t ComponentIndexType or Index for any type of geometry, despite having the correct type hints.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n1138×854 71 KB\n\n\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n\nAs an aside, if I have the type hint in the input set to Brep, what is the easiest way to get the GUID?  I made a separate input here, but would like avoid this in the future.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDan",
