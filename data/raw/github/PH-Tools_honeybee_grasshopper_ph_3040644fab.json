This \n'building-segment' could be a single floor, a 'wing' or an entire building and will \nmap to a single 'Case' in WUFI or a single PHPP file.\n-\nSince Passive House models only allow for a single thermal zone, any honeybee-rooms \nthat are part of the building-segment will be merged / joined when exported to \nWUFI-Passive or PHPP. When merged, only the exterior surfaces will be retained, and \nany faces with a 'Surface' boundary condition well be removed from the Passive House \nmodel. Only Honeybee Faces with boundary conditions of \"Outdoors\", \"Ground\" and \n\"Adiabatic\" will be included in the new Honeybee Room. \n-\nUse this before passing the honeybee-rooms on to the 'HB Model' component.\n-\nEM June 6, 2024\n    Args:\n        segment_name_: Name for the building-segment\n               \n        num_floor_levels_: (int) Total number of floor levels for the group of \n            Honeybee rooms input.

For non-residential, leave this set to \"1\".\n        \n        climate_: Optional Passive House monthly climate data.\n        \n        source_energy_factors_: (Optional) A list of source energy (site->source) energy \n            factors to use for assessing overall source (primary) energy usage. By default, \n            this component will use the standard Phius 2021 source energy factors which can be \n            found at https://www.phius.org/PHIUS+2021/Phius%20Core_Phius%20Zero_Final%20Modeling%20Protocol%20v1.1.pdf\n            -\n            Use the \"Create Conversion Factor\" component to define custom factors if you would \n            like to use your own.

By default, \n            this component will use the standard Phius 2021 CO2e factors which can be \n            found at https://www.phius.org/PHIUS+2021/Phius%20Core_Phius%20Zero_Final%20Modeling%20Protocol%20v1.1.pdf\n            -\n            Use the \"Create Conversion Factor\" component to define custom factors if you would \n            like to use your own.

For instance on the roof, or in a semi-\n            heated outdoor space such as a garage or breezeway. For Phius Certification, \n            use the 'ERV_HRV_Outside Calculator' tool which can be downloaded from the \n            Phius website www.phius.org\n\n        non_combustible_materials_: (bool) Default=False.
