  "question": "If you do a mouse drag selection (rectangular selection) over BrepEdges,  edges will be selected once for every face that they touch. This is not an intuitive result. Maybe there is a good reason for this to happen, but for me it just caused bugs.\n\n\nMaybe Rhino devs would appreciate this feedback.\n\n\nBest,\n\nNick",
