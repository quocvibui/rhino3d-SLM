  "question": "Hi guys,\n\n\nIn the code below\n\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\nimport ghpythonlib.components as gh\n\npt = rg.Point3d(0,0,0)\nsphere = rg.Sphere(pt, 12)\na = rg.Mesh.CreateQuadSphere(sphere, 1)\nb = gh.FaceNormals(a)\n\n\n\nthe Facenormals method has 2 different outputs (A list of center points and a list of normal vectors). So right now, python doesn’t know which one of these 2 outputs to designate to ‘b’. So I was wondering if it is possible to choose which output for ‘b’ to be designated to?\n\n\nThanks!!",
