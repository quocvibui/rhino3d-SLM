  "title": "GHpython - looping through matrix to extract values",
  "question": "Hey everyone,\n\n\nSo I have managed to create a matrix with different solar radiation values relative to the orientation. These values are divided into each month (therefore a matrix has been created). Now I want to extract these values so that I can calculate with them. I have a list with orientation and I want to loop through the list using this orientation-list to extract the values. At the same time I’m trying to loop through with the months, but I must admit that I have come up short when trying to loop through a matrix as I have never done it before. I’ll link a picture and the file and hopefully some of you know what to do.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion_Arrayloops\n1310×763 131 KB\n\n\n\n\nWorking_Weatherfile.gh\n (39.6 KB)",
