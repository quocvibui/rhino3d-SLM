  "title": "Rhinoscriptsyntax ViewCameraUp - Rhino 8",
  "question": "Another thing that works in R7 but not R8. Why is R8 so limited and full of bugs? How long it has been out of beta phase? Why simple things like this still do not work? Why do they start R9 when R8 is in such a bad state? Why do I get almost 0 support for R8 bugs?\n\n\nI’ve tried searching the forum but obviously this is new and not mentioned anywhere yet. Fine. I copied example from \nRhino - RhinoScriptSyntax\n and it does not work. Why, why and why??? What am I suppose to do when going back to R7 is not an option???\n\n\nimage\n524×694 16.2 KB\n\n\nimage\n514×692 16 KB",
