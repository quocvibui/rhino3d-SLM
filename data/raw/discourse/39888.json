  "title": "How to shorten a curve by a given length in Rhino Python",
  "question": "Hi, I’am new to Rhino Python.\n\nI’m trying to shorten a curve by a given length. (More specifically cut the first 5 cm form a given curve.)\n\nI am able to find the cutting point by using rs.DivideCurveLength:\n\n\nnewstartpoint=(rs.DivideCurveLength(crv,cutdist,False,True))[1]\n\n\nBut then I’m stuck as I can’t find how to trim a curve with a point.\n\n\nI guess it would be easier using rs.TrimCurve(). But therefore I need to reparametrize the curve.\n\nIs there a way in Rhino Python to adapt the Curve Domain to [0.0,rs.CurveLength(crv)]?\n\n\nThanks for your help and Merry Christmas to all of you!",
