  "title": "Small problem with Python/Rhinocommon Vector3f",
  "question": "One is supposed to be able to scale vector objects by simply multiplying them by a number:\n\n\nimport Rhino\nvec=Rhino.Geometry.Vector3d(0,0,1)\nmult=2.0\nscaled=vec*mult\nprint scaled\n>>> (0,0,2)\n\n\n\nHowever, with a vector3f object instead of vector3d object, there is a problem:\n\n\nimport Rhino\nvec=Rhino.Geometry.Vector3f(0,0,1)\nmult=2\nscaled=vec*mult\nprint scaled\n#this works\n>>> (0,0,2)\n\nmult=2.0\nscaled=vec*mult\n#this errors out\n>>> Message: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'Vector3f' and 'float'\n\n\n\nSo it is accepting integer values, but not floats…\n\n\nOnly reason I found this is that mesh vertex normals seem to be output as vector3f and not vector3d.\n\n\n–Mitch",
