  "title": "Fillet radius limited on curve",
  "question": "I encountered something that I can’t explain. this simple example file has a few points that make up a polyline which gets a fillet at the end. but why is the fillet radius limited? looks like the radius is limited to exactly half of the length of the first/last polyline segment.\n\nif I bake the curve, I can of course give it a larger fillet in rhino, like expected.\n\n\ncan someone explain to me what happens there in gh?\n\n\nsure I can just build what I need from line and arc segments, but this would require a few more points and vectors. no big deal, but I do prefer the option with the least amount of components.\n\n\nradius-capped.gh\n (11.4 KB)",
