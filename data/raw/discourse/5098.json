  "title": "IsCircle behaves differently between Rhinoscript and Python",
  "question": "It’s probably something I’m doing wrong, but here it goes anyway:\n\n\nI have some objects which were created by extracting edgecurves and joining then together. They appear to be circles even though they technically aren’t.\n\n\nWith Rhinoscript, the IsCircle method recognizes these objects as circles, and I can determine a diameter using the CircleRadius method. That’s what I need to do.\n\n\nIn Python, is seems that the IsCircle definition  is now stricter, and these objects are not recognized as circles (or even arcs). I need to determine the diameter of these objects, so this is not a good twist.\n\n\nI will attach a Rhino file and 2 scripts (one Rhinoscript and one Python) for testing. Maybe this change is intentional, and there is a simple workaround?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDan\n\n\nIsItACircle.py\n (344 Bytes)\n\n\nIsItACircle.rvb\n (348 Bytes)\n\n\nAre these circles or not.3dm\n (74.9 KB)",
