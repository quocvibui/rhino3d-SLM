  "title": "(De-) Serialize between Rhino3dmIO and RhinoCommon problem",
  "question": "Lets say i create a PolylineCurve in Visual Studio and Rhino3dmIO and pack it in a binary stream, send it to Rhino and want to deserialize it back to a PolylineCurve. This does not work as they are from different a assembly (Rhino3dmIO and RhinoCommon respectively)\n\n\nWhat would be the best way to go about that? It should work with all kinds of geometry…\n\nthanks!\n\n\ndifference as string here:\n\n\n\n\nquestion\n761×623 34.8 KB",
