  "title": "Canvas mouse down event",
  "question": "I have implemented custom drop down lists for my components using \nGH_ComponentAttributes\n (image below). The problem is that the \nRespondToMouseDown\n callback only fires when the mouse is clicked when on top of the component, while when the list is open the options appear beyond the layout bounds of the component.\n\n\nTo register the mouse events, I have therefore skipped \nRespondToMouseDown\n altogether and I am using \nActiveCanvas\n events like so:\n\n\nif (Grasshopper.Instances.ActiveCanvas != null) {\n    Grasshopper.Instances.ActiveCanvas.MouseMove += mouseMoved;\n    Grasshopper.Instances.ActiveCanvas.MouseDown += mouseDown;\n}\n\n\n\nThe issue I am facing with this approach is that the callback functions for these events do not have a way to notify Grasshopper that the mouse event was handled elsewhere. Therefore, the clicks are handled by me and are also handled by Grasshopper itself leading to, for example, dragging the component.\n\n\nThe \nRespondToMouseDown\n callback function has a \nGH_ObjectResponse\n return type which allows you to inform Grasshopper that the click was handled so it won’t bother handling it as well. The \nActiveCanvas\n events do not have such a mechanism. Is there a way to go around that?",
