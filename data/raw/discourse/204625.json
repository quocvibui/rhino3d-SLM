  "question": "Hello all \n\n\nFirst question for me here. As a beginer in Rhino scripting I need a helpful hand !\n\n\nI would like to create a polyline with fillet in place of some corners. The idea is doing a parametric Holland profil shape to extrude it.\n\n\n20250517_145920\n273×702 1.52 KB\n\n\nI have this example but there is no fillets…\n\n\ndef create_polyline():\n    A = (0, 0, 0)\n    B = (10, 0, 0)\n    C = (10, 20, 0)\n    D = (5, 25, 0)\n\n    points = [A, B, C, D, A]\n    polyligne = rs.AddPolyline(points)\n\n\n\nHow to replace corner C by a fillet radius 2 for instance ? Someone to help me please ?\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nJay",
