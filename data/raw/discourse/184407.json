  "question": "OK, this is a user pain experience when using ETO.WebView as a UI on MacOS.\n\n\nI’ve recently added a module that needs the user to select geometry in the Rhino document from my GH/ETO.Webview based plugin.\n\n\nThis becomes an absolute click fest.\n\n\nClick the button in my UI to activate the selection\n\n\nClick on Rhino ONCE to change the focus from the Webview UI to the Rhino Doc\n\n\nClick on the actual geometry you want to select in the Rhino\n\n\nClick on the Webview to change the focus to the UI\n\n\nClick on the next selection button and repeat the click/click/click/click\n\n\nFour clicks to do what only takes 2 clicks in Windows is just clunky - is there a way to make not have the change of focus clicks needed??\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nDK",
