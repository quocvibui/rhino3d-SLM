  "title": "Gumball after programmatically selecting objects",
  "question": "I have a python script that is selecting objects for the user.  Everything works as expected, the end result being a bunch of highlighted objects in the viewports.  However, the gumball doesn’t ever show up after the command is complete.  Is there some call I can make to ‘refresh’ the gumball?  My google/discourse-foo hasn’t been able to shed any light on the subject, and I haven’t found anything obvious (to me anyway) looking through the doc or app functions.\n\n\nI’ve tried using rs.SelectObject, scriptcontext.doc.Select, and rhinobject.Select().  They all behave the same.\n\n\nInterestingly, if I do something like close and reopen the python editor, the gumball appears.\n\n\nNvidia driver up to date.\n\n\nEdit -\n\n\nUsing \nrs.Command(\"GumballReset\")\n at the end of the script seems to redraw the gumball, but if there is a more correct way to do that I’d like to know.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nNathan",
