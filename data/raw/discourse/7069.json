  "question": "I could use an UnlockAllObjects method. Currently, the unlock methods require objects id’s, but sometimes I need to unlock everything in the file. I have one scenario where I lock everything that isn’t a cylinder or a planar surface. When the task is done, I use the regular Rhino command “Unlock” to unlock everything, It seems to me a Python method would be handy.\n\n\nSecondly, I could really use a method for sorting cylinders that are complete, not just portions. In our business we deal with a lot of holes, and a IsCylinderClosed method would be VERY useful. I don’t need to know if the ends are capped, just that the cylindrical surface forms a true cylinder. Currently, the IsCylinder method also finds fillets.\n\n\nOf course, if any of this is currently possible and I’m not seeing it, I welcome suggestions.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDan",
