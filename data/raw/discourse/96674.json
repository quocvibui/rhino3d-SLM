  "title": "RhinoScriptSyntax BoundingBox issue",
  "question": "I’m trying to get a 2D bounding box for a polyline in a plane.  The BoundingBox component seems to be failing to coerce geometry from my Polylines.  Is this because I’m trying to do a 2D operation when it needs to be 3D? Is it a glitch?  Thanks for any help.\n\n\n\n\nBBox Issue\n1059×747 55.4 KB\n\n\n \nBBoxProblem.gh\n (7.3 KB)",
