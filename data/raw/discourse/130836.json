  "title": "How to judge the type of variable in python?",
  "question": "I need to judge the type of the input variable when I use rhinoscriptsyntax so that I can convert those geometry objects to Guid perversely and avoid some TypeError in the program. But it returns a problem when I just directly use the name of the type like this:\n\n\nif type(x) == Point3d:\n    print('true')\n\n\n\nSo I want to know how to judge the type of geometry like Point3d, Curve, and also Guid. I think that might hide in another library.  I hop that someone can offer some help to me.",
