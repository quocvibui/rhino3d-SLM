  "title": "ViewCamera: No overload for method",
  "question": "I am following a video tutorial on how to control the camera from Grasshopper in order to create a fly-through animation: \nControl and Animate the Camera with 6 lines of code GH Python Rhino 7 - Beginners Tutorial - 002\n\n\nUnfortunately, I get an error message when trying to set the camera. Here is a simplified example:\n\n\nScreenshot of Grasshopper definition and code\n1238×1223 117 KB\n\n\n2025-06-05+02_no_overload.gh\n (6.8 KB)\n\n\nHow do I make that work in Rhino 8’s Grasshopper?\n\n\nIf there is an alternative way to control the camera, I should be fine with that too, as long as it doesn’t require plugins. The traditional non-Grasshopper way of doing fly-through animations fails for me. See my recent posts in the thread: \nParts of Rhino Model Disappear During Flythrough Animation\n.",
