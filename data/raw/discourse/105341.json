  "title": "Rhino 6 SR27 critical issue with Grasshopper component via Python",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nCode I’ve had in production for a year seems to have been broken by the latest version of Rhino.\n\n\nI do not know if this is a general issue with calling into grasshopper components from the iron python environment, or if it specific to ghpythonlib.components.catenary().\n\n\nAs of Rhino 6 SR27, a call to ghpythonlib.components.catenary() will return ‘None’ with the following warnings:\n\nWarning: Catenary: input 1 point_a. warning: Input parameter A failed to collect data\n\nWarning: Catenary: solver component. warning: Input parameter A failed to collect data\n\n\nPlease let me know where I can download prior Rhino Service releases.\n I’m on a critical job and need to revert to a working version immediately.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nMinimal example:\n\n\n\nimport  rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport  Rhino\n\nimport  ghpythonlib.components as ghc\nfrom    Rhino.Geometry import Vector3d, Point3d\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        cat = ghc.Catenary( Point3d(0,0,0), Point3d(100,100,0), 200, Vector3d(0,0,-1) )",
