  "title": "Cannot delete an object created by ghpythonlib",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nWhat I am trying to do is to create a cutting brep to split a surface. After I succeed to create the brep I would like to delete the ‘edge1’. But for some reason I cannot delete edge1. I guess because it was created by a grasshopper method. When I use print to check its id it doesn’t the id (see attached).\n\n\n\n\nSplit Surface 01.PNG\n903×897 50.1 KB\n\n\n\nDoes it mean that the edge1 doesn’t exist in Rhino so I don’t need to delete it?\n\nIs it a polyline that only exists within grasshopper?\n\n\n\n\nSplit Surface 02.PNG\n905×896 56.6 KB\n\n\n\n\nSplit Surface.py\n (1.0 KB)\n\nCan anyone explain a little bit of it? Just want to have a better understand of use ghpythonlib in rhino python.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJ",
