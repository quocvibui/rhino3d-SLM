After running DesignPH\nto generate the shading factors, go to 'AREAS | SHADING' and simply select and copy all the    \ntext from this section. Paste this copied text into a Multiline Panel in GH, and then input \nthis panel text into the the component here. \n-\nOnce all the shading factors are extracted, pass them to a \"HBPH - Apply Shading Factors\"\ncomponent in order to apply these factors to actual HB-Apertures.\n-\nIf you have deciduous trees, or other seasonal variation in shading, you should run DesignPH\ntwice, and copy/paste the data from both runs into GH-Panels. Use two of this component in \norder to extract the seasonal shading factors separately for each of the runs.\n-\nEM February 15, 2024\n    Args:\n        _hb_apertures: (List[Aperture]) A list of Honeybee-Apertures to which are \n            used to sort and order the shading-factors.\n    \n        _design_ph_text: (List[str]) The text copied from DesignPH's Areasl/Shading section.\n            It is expected that the text blob looks like -\n[\n    <empty>, \n    <empty>,\n    1,\n    C.0.1,\n    4 - South Windows,\n    0.91,\n    2.03,\n    Wall_002_S,\n    0.22,\n    0.23,\n    <empty>,\n    <empty>,\n    2,\n    N.0.z,\n    ...\n]\n \n    Returns:\n        winter_shading_factors_: (List[float]) A list of the winter-shading-factors extracted from the DesignPH\n            text blob.
