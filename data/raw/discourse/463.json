  "title": "CNC - generating toolpaths",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nWe build cabins and use a lot of 18mm ply which is cut and routed to be assembled as structural parts.  Currently I design in Rhino, lay out the parts flat, use make3d, export as dxf then import the dxf into VCarve which I use to generate toolpaths.  In VCarve I might need to make offsets, join curves to create closed areas for pocketing and add ‘dog bone’ fillets for corners.  It’s time consuming but it works.\n\n\nHowever… does anyone know of a way I might streamline this by producing toolpaths directly from the parts in my Rhino file - especially without having to lay them out flat?  Can MadCam or RhinoCam or some other add on do this for me?\n\n\nNick",
