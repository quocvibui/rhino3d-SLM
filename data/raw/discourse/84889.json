  "title": "Move grouped curves in Python Rhino",
  "question": "Hey guys, I’m trying to find a way to move and perhaps rotate a group of curves that was already imported into Rhino.\n\nI wanted to complete this through python script editor but so far the rhinosyntax library i know that can achieve such thing is by getting individual object’s GUID and then move it.\n\nI was wondering if it is possible to move a group at a time.\n\neven if there’s anywhere I can start from that would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",
