  "question": "Hello everyone\n\n\nI am passing a Volume command to Rhino from a Rhino Python console. This is a sample code:\n\n\nrs.Command(’-SelAll’)\n\nrs.Command(’-Volume’)\n\n\nThis results in a volume result being printed in the Rhino command line:\n\n\n‘Volume = 4018.98077 (+/- 1e-06) cubic millimeters’\n\n\nHow to get the above message returned to the python code? I need to reuse it within the code. I have already tried doing it with the rs.SurfaceVolume() command, but it fails due to the surface being open, not closed. I have 2 naked edges in my geometry which I cannot get rid of and so I cannot close the surface. Increasing absolute tolerance did not help. For this reason, I must run rs.Command() rather than rs.SurfaceVolume.\n\n\nAny thoughts much appreciated.\n\n\nKasia",
