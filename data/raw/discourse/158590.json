  "title": "Problem using RhinoCommon in PyCharm",
  "question": "Hi forum,\n\nThis might be quite obvious to many of you, but I’ve only recently started working with Python in general, not to mention the strange and constantly shifting integration of coding tools within Rhino.\n\n\nI am trying to move away from IronPython for us to be able to use tools like pandas and numpy. But now that I’m trying to move everything I wrote in the Python tool in grasshopper, I can’t seem to make it work. I tried starting with very small examples:\n\n\nimport rhino3dm as rg\n\npt1 = rg.Point3d(0, 0, 0)\npt2 = rg.Point3d(0, 0, 1)\nline1 = rg.Line(pt1, pt2)\nline_length = rg.Line.Length(line1)\n\nprint(line_length)\n\n\n\nI installed the rhino3dm module along with the rhino-stubs one.\n\nIf I don’t do the “rg.Line.Length(line1)” part it seems that it works, print(line1) gives me:\n\n\n<rhino3dm._rhino3dm.Line object at 0x0000018C04A694B0>\n\n\n\nWhereas when trying to just add a length command to it brings up an error:\n\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\...\\TEST\\main.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    line_length = rg.Line.Length(line1)\nTypeError: 'property' object is not callable\n\n\n\nThat’s even before I even started thinking about how to import our own geometry from GH/Rhino into PyCharm not to mention export the results back.\n\n\nAny ideas? What am I doing wrong? Will I have to re-write all of our codes with compute_rhino3d instead? I can’t even find a way to create a simple Point3D with compute_rhino3d commands…\n\n\nI’m even willing to pay for private lessons regarding this entire thing, it’s almost impossible to find concrete information for beginners.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nLev",
