  "question": "Had a memry leak in a large prorgam, which made the program eather break or slow dawn alot:\n\n\nThe main problem was fund in the CopyObject -> DeleteObject functions:\n\n\nThe small test example below increased the memory uses by 474000 kb which it not freed laiter.\n\n\ns = rs.AddSphere([0,0,0], 25)\n\nfor i in range(1000):\n    tmp = rs.CopyObject(s)\n    rs.DeleteObject(tmp)\n\n\n\nHave tried gc.collect() to force the collecting, with no result.",
