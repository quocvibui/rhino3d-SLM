  "question": "Hi All,\n\n\nDoes anyone know how can I use make 2d drawing in C#? OR how the make 2d drawing works?\n\n\nI need to get the 2d top and side view of my 3d models Automatically with my C# plugin so I either have to use something like make 2d ( which I don’t know what that would be. ) or find out how that works and make one for myself.\n\n\non the other hand, using the runscript is the last option because it is too slow loading.\n\nthanks,",
