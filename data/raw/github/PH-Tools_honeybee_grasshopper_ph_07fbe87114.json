These \nare written to the 'Shading' worksheet in the PHPP which will then calculate \nshading factors based on these dimensions. \n-\nReference: Shading factors will go from 0.0 (fully shaded) to 1.0 (fully unshaded) and are \ncalculated using the simplified numerical method as implemented in the Passive \nHouse Planning Package and DesignPH 1.5 or earlier. \n-\nNote that this method matches the 'old' style PHPP input (before DesignPH 2). It is \na pretty fast way for the PHPP to calc. shading factors, but might be a bit less \naccurate than other methods for irregular situations (asymetric shading, irregular trees, etc).\nIt's useful if you want to match the exact procedure of an older style PHPP document.\n-\nFor background and reference on the methodology used, see: \"Solar Gains in a \nPassive House: A Monthly Approach to Calculating Global Irradiaton Entering a \nShaded Window\" By Andrew Peel, 2007.\n-\nEM February 11, 2025\n    Args:\n        _shading_surfaces: (List[Brep]) <Optional> Any shading geometry (walls, overhangs, side-reveals\n            neighbors, trees, etc...) you'd like to take into account when generating \n            shading factors.
