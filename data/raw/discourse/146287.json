  "title": "Save render to multiple resolutions / resize [Rhino Python]",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI am writing a Plug-in in Rhino Python. One of the functionalities is to trigger the rendering process and then save and close the render window. Now, I would like to save the rendered image at two resolutions:\n\n\n- Full-res\n\n\n- Resized to the web-acceptable size\n\n\nIdeally, I would use PIL (pillow) module from Python to resize the image, but that’s not available in IronPython. I didn’t find anything useful in System. Drawing either. It is important, that the solution can be integrated into the plug-in to later be compiled into the .yak package.\n\n\nThe current code just uses the last RenderSettings and gets the image out.\n\n\n    def render_viewport(render_path):\n        Rhino.RhinoApp.RunScript(\"_Render\",False)\n        Rhino.RhinoApp.RunScript(\"_-SaveRenderWindowAs \" + '\"' + render_path + '\"', True)\n        Rhino.RhinoApp.RunScript(\"_-CloseRenderWindow \",True)\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any idea?\n\n\nBest,\n\nWK",
