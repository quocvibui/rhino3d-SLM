  "title": "Can't run Command from custom Python Command in Rhino 6",
  "question": "I have previously made some custom Python commands in Rhino 5, but when trying them out in Rhino 6, commands that calls commands in the Rhino Commandline doesn’t work anymore. Calling rhino commands from a python script directly in the Python editor works fine. I have tried with both rhinoscriptsyntax and RhinoCommon. Example of python command not  working:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\n__commandname__ = \"Test\"\n\ndef RunCommand( is_interactive ):\n    rs.Command(\"Line \")\n    return 0\n\n\n\nHowever calling this from the python editor works:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\n__commandname__ = \"Test\"\n\ndef RunCommand( is_interactive ):\n    rs.Command(\"Line \")\n    return 0\nRunCommand(True)\n\n\n\nAnd all other custom python commands without \nrs.Command(\"rhinocommand\")\n works fine",
