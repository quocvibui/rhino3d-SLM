  "question": "Hi Guys,\n\n\nJust throwing this out there for discussion/possible solution.\n\n\nI have a few people using my kite design software online via Shapediver:\n\n\nhttps://www.karorocad.online/\n\n\nI would like to be able to offer an ‘offline’ solution to my users, but don’t want to just give away my Grasshopper source code.\n\n\nHas anyone looked at or built a local front end for headless Rhino/GH that would allow some sort of secure encapsulation of the GH source while giving the user access to the controls?\n\n\nHonestly I wouldn’t mind in the slightest if I needed to buy a Rhino license for every offline user of my code as long as I could package it all up in a secure way.\n\n\nOr am I just best to create one big password protected cluster and hope that service and support will keep people happy enough to deal with me.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nDK\n\n\n(\n@DavidRutten\n - can you create a ‘Grasshopper Complier’ if I ask really nicely - PLEASE?)",
