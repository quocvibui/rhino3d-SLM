  "title": "Rotation of hatch with rs.AddHatch: counterclockwise change in clockwise",
  "question": "Hello all,\n\n\nI have develloped a python script that follow a line and will create a lot of small hatch zone. For all hatch, I want to control the rotation, but some time the value of angle is counterclockwise and some time clockwise. If I select the hatch and try to change the value, the hatch stay counterclock or clock depending of what it was. And if I create the hatch in the closed curve with the command _hatch outside of the EditPythonScript, it will be always counterclockwise. Below, a picture of my problem! Do you have an idea to fix my probleme please? Thanks in advance.\n\n\n\n\nImage1.png\n1087×587 157 KB",
