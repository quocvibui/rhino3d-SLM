  "title": "rs.GetPoint() won't accept a pasted coordinate but \"_Point\" will",
  "question": "Hi \n@dale\n, I use rs.GetPoint() to get a point (obviously) but sometimes I know the coordinate and have it copied to clipboard and want to paste that in instead, but that doesn’t work.\n\n\nBut this works for the command _Point, so I workaround this by first adding a point and then snapping to that with rs.GetPoint(). But that isn’t a smooth workaround, so could you add the ability to paste a coordinate for rs.GetPoint()?\n\n\nLet’s say I want to use this coordinate in the script: 10080,20085,0\n\n\nThe strange thing is that if I type it in then it works, but if I paste it then I get this error message:\n\n\nUnknown command: 119080,1191385,0\n\n\nPlease try it out with this super simple example\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nprint rs.GetPoint()\n\n\n\n(I have a system where I set up a reference point as a local origin for architecture, and I often want to copy this data to another file)",
