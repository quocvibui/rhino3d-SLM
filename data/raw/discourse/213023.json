  "title": "Selection filter CRhinoGetObject::curve_object finds also mesh edges",
  "question": "When I start a Curve selection with \nCRhinoGetObject::curve_object\n in Rhino 8 in a command and the Curve is on top of a mesh the selection finds also mesh edges. This is very annoying and was not the case in earlier versions. Example:\n\n\n____\n\n\nunsigned int geometry_type_filter = 0;\n\ngeometry_type_filter |= CRhinoGetObject::curve_object;\n\n\nCRhinoGetObject getInputObject;\n\ngetInputObject.SetCommandPrompt(L\"Select 2 to 4 Curves\");\n\ngetInputObject.SetGeometryFilter(geometry_type_filter);\n\n\nCRhinoGet::result myResult = getInputObject.GetObjects(2, 4);\n\n\n____\n\n\nHow can I avoid it programmatically? I know, when I switch off the “Mesh” filter in the GUI the selection returns only a curve or surface edge, but I would like to configure it in my code prior the selection.\n\n\nI tried also \ngetInputObject.SetGeometryAttributeFilter()\n but did not know what input to use.",
