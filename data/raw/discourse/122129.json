  "question": "Hi guys,\n\n\nI am developing an algorithm where I need to cull all the duplicates points from a list.\n\nThe number of points can become really big and I would like to optimize a little bit the script.\n\n\nAnyone knows how can I make the process as fast as for the grasshopper component?\n\n\nThis is the code that I am using\n\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\n\na = rg.Point3d.CullDuplicates(x, 0.001)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the native Grasshopper component is more than 10 times faster from the python one.\n\nAny suggestion?\n\n\n\n\nimage\n782×560 46.7 KB",
