  "question": "I know this is going to get eyeballs rolling given everything else going on.\n\n\nBut using grasshopper is very much like functional programming isn’t it. I don’t know if any of you have used F# but, well it’s pretty damned good and it’s a more natural segue into coding proper from grasshopper given the functional programming bent.\n\n\nI just thought, well there are already scripting editors for C# and ironpython in gh, it surely can’t be a biggie adding another for F#, could it? I mean it’s dot net after all. Hey, add VB whilst you’re in there too! \n\n\nJust an idea. Don’t shoot me.\n\n\nI bet David Rutten will be cursing me for suggesting this",
