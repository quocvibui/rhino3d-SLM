  "title": "Python Script First Run Has Delay - Rhino 6",
  "question": "I have a lot of scripts set as keyboard shortcuts. Any script has a noticeable delay on first run after Rhino 6 startup. Rhino 5 doesn’t have this issue. All subsequent runs work normal. It must be related to initialization of the interpreter.\n\n\nDid anyone else notice this or am I nitpicking?",
