  "question": "I am looking for a script, RVB, to find curves that are contained within another curve\n\n\nAll the curves lay on the same plane\n\n\nAll the curves are closed and do not intersect, no self-intersections\n\n\nI am not concerned with multiple nesting, curves within at a second level, I can have the script that finds nested curves move them to a new layer and rerun the script on that layer",
