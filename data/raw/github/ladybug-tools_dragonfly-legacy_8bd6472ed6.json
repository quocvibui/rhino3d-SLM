Alternatively, this can be a list of numbers with a number of stories for each footprint in _geo above.\n        _program: One of the 16 building programs listed from the \"DF Bldg Programs\" component.  The following options are available:\n            FullServiceRestaurant\n            Hospital\n            LargeHotel\n            LargeOffice\n            MediumOffice\n            MidRiseApartment\n            OutPatient\n            PrimarySchool\n            QuickServiceRestaurant\n            SecondarySchool\n            SmallHotel\n            SmallOffice\n            StandAloneRetail\n            StripMall\n            SuperMarket\n            Warehouse\n        _age: An integer that sets the age of the buildings represented by this typology.  This is used to determine what constructions make up the walls, roofs, and windows based on international building codes over the last several decades.  Choose from the following options:\n            Pre-1980's\n            1980's-Present\n            New Construction\n        _flr_to_flr_: A number that sets the average distance between floors for the building typology.  This will be used to compute the total floor area of the building, which ultimately determines the influence that the typology has on the urban microclimate.\n        _fract_canyon_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the fraction of the building's waste heat from air conditioning that gets rejected into the urban canyon (as opposed to through rooftop equipment or into a ground source loop).  The default is set to 0.5.\n        _run: Set to \"True\" to run the component and generate a building typology.\n    Returns:\n        read_me: ...\n        -------------: ...\n        typology: A Dragonfly building typology object that can be plugged into the \"DF City\" component.\n        -------------: ...\n        perim_crvs: A list of curves showing the exterior-exposed edges of the footprints.\n\"\"\"\n\nghenv.Component.Name = \"DF Typology from Footprints\"\nghenv.Component.NickName = 'FootprintTypology'\nghenv.Component.Message = 'VER 0.0.03\\nMAR_25_2020'\nghenv.Component.Category = \"DF-Legacy\"\nghenv.Component.SubCategory = \"1 | Urban Weather\"\n#compatibleDFVersion = VER 0.0.02\\nMAY_12_2018\nghenv.Component.AdditionalHelpFromDocStrings = \"2\"\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Grasshopper.Kernel as gh\n\n#Dragonfly check.\ninit_check = True\nif not sc.sticky.has_key('dragonfly_release') == True:\n    init_check = False\n    print \"You should first let Drafgonfly fly...\"\n    ghenv.Component.AddRuntimeMessage(gh.GH_RuntimeMessageLevel.Warning, \"You should first let Drafgonfly fly...\")\nelse:\n    if not sc.sticky['dragonfly_release'].isCompatible(ghenv.Component): init_check = False\n    if sc.sticky['dragonfly_release'].isInputMissing(ghenv.Component): init_check = False\n    df_BuildingTypology = sc.sticky[\"dragonfly_BuildingTypology\"]\n\nif init_check == True and _run == True:\n    if len(_num_floors) == 1:\n        typology, perim_crvs = df_BuildingTypology.from_footprints(_geo, _num_floors[0],\n            _program, _age, _flr_to_flr_, _fract_canyon_)\n    elif len(_num_floors) == len(_geo):\n        typology, perim_crvs = df_BuildingTypology.from_footprints_and_stories(_geo, _num_floors[0],\n            _program, _age, _flr_to_flr_, _fract_canyon_)\n    else:\n        raise IndexError('_num_floors must either be a single value or a list of values that match the surfaces in _geo')",
