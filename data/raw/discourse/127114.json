  "title": "How to contral the orientation of offset with rhinoscriptsyntax",
  "question": "I meet a problem when I am programming with rhinoscriptsyntax.Basically, I need to offset a curve to the direction that contrary to it (like the picture show). But when I use the OffsetCurve command, I find out that the ‘direction’ parameter, which inputed as a point or a Vector3D, can not adjust the direction of the offset. In this case, I use (0, -1, 0) as a direction, but it still points in the positive direction of the y-axis. The only that I can control the direction is to use the positive and negative values of distance.\n\n\n\nMy question is: How to control the orientation of offset with a vector or point, but not positive and negative of numbers.\n\nThat is my first forum of this forum, I sincerely ask the experts for help😊",
