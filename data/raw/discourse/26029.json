  "title": "How to create a plane surface that is more that 5 points?",
  "question": "from Rhino.Geometry import NurbsSurface, Point3d\n\nfrom scriptcontext import doc\n\n\nsurface = NurbsSurface.CreateFromCorners(\n\nPoint3d(5, 0, 0),\n\nPoint3d(5, 5, 5),\n\nPoint3d(0, 5, 0),\n\nPoint3d(0, 0, 0));\n\n\ndoc.Objects.AddSurface(surface);\n\ndoc.Views.Redraw();\n\n\nThis seems to work only up to 5 points only. How can I do more than that? Or create a plane from lines works too, but what I found only script that makes user to pick curves to generate the plane. How to automate the selection without interruption?\n\n\nThanks.",
