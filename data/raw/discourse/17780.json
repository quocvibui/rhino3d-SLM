  "title": "Best way to select objects created by current run of script?",
  "question": "I am working on a script that Would create 5 to 20 objects each time it is run. I would like to then block all the new objects and then place the block. What would be the best way to select just the objects created by this run of the script? Or is there a better way to add those objects to a new and unique block?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRobb",
