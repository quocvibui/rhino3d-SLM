The toolkit does not include a\n    number of important features, including:\n\n    *   Closest point calculations\n    *   Intersection calculations\n    *   Surface tessellation (meshing)\n    *   Interpolation\n    *   Booleans\n    *   Area and mass property calculations\n    *   Other miscellaneous geometry calculations\n\n    [ Note from McNeel's website on openNURBS ]\n\n\nMore Information about openNURBES in the links below:\n    * `Github Repo <https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon/tree/rhino3dmio>`_\n    * `RhinoCommon API <http://developer.rhino3d.com/api/>`_\n    * `openNURBS <http://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/opennurbs/what-is-opennurbs/>`_\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom rpw.utils.dotnet import clr\nclr.AddReference('Rhino3dmIO')\n\nimport Rhino\n",
