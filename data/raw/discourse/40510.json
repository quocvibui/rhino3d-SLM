  "question": "Hey all,\n\nI’m working on developing a grasshopper plugin using the Rhino 6 WIP (so that I can write the plugin using python).\n\n\nI am trying to work out how to persist an array of text values each time a gh definition is saved. The text values would contain information about the user who is saving the file.\n\n\nBy persistence, I mean that I’d like these values to be part of the file itself. Basically if the definition is opened on another computer, the values can be read, \nbut\n if the file is \nsaved\n using the new computer, the values will be automatically overwritten.\n\n\nI found this thread from 2014:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrasshopper3d.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Persistence in GH Components\n\n\nHi David.\nI noticed in a lot of your components, there exists data persistence properties. For example, your Swatch component, you can copy and paste this comp…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the correct approach? If so, could someone elaborate on where the question asker’s code came from? Will including a write() method in a class be sufficient? Is some other approach better, if being executed in python?\n\n\nMany thanks",
