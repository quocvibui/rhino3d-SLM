This component allows you to input both types of \nvalues and will approximate the NFRC values from the ISO inputs. However, do note that this approximation \nis NOT valid for north-american code compliance modeling and is included here only to help those doing \nPassive House modeling. Be sure to enter both the ISO *AND* NFRC values if you need both. The NFRC values \nwill be used for all EnergyPlus simulatiuons, while the ISO values will be used for all Passive House\nmodels and outputs.\n\n-\nEM March 22, 2023\n    Args:\n        _name_: (str)\n        \n        _frame: (PhWindowFrame) A HBPH Window Frame to build the window construction from.\n        \n        _glazing: (PhWindowGlazing) A HBPH Window Glazing to build the window construction from.\n       \n        _shade: (Optional[EnergyWindowMaterialShade]) An Optional solar shade (roller blind) to add to the \n            window construction. This will show up as a Solar Protection device in WUFI. Use an \n            \"HB - Shade Material\" and set the \"_transmittance_\" input to desired value. Note that\n            for WUFI and PHPP, the other values such as thickness and emissivity are disregarded.
