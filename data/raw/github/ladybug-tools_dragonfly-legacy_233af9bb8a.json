The default is set to 0.1, which is typical of fresh asphalt.\n        _thickness_: A number that represents the thickness of the pavement material in meters (m).  The default is set to 0.5 meters.\n        _conductivity_:  A number representing the conductivity of the pavement material in W/m-K.  This is the heat flow in Watts across one meter thick of the material when the temperature difference on either side is 1 Kelvin. The default is set to 1 W/m-K, which is typical of asphalt.\n        _vol_heat_cap_:  A number representing the volumetric heat capacity of the pavement material in J/m3-K.  This is the number of joules needed to raise one cubic meter of the material by 1 degree Kelvin.  The default is set to 1,600,000 J/m3-K, which is typical of asphalt.\n    Returns:\n        pavement_par: Pavement parameters that can be plugged into the \"DF uwg City\" component.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nghenv.Component.Name = \"DF Pavement Parameters\"\nghenv.Component.NickName = 'PavementPar'\nghenv.Component.Message = 'VER 0.0.03\\nMAR_25_2020'\nghenv.Component.Category = \"DF-Legacy\"\nghenv.Component.SubCategory = \"1 | Urban Weather\"\n#compatibleDFVersion = VER 0.0.02\\nMAY_20_2018\nghenv.Component.AdditionalHelpFromDocStrings = \"5\"\n\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Grasshopper.Kernel as gh\n\n#Dragonfly check.\ninit_check = True\nif not sc.sticky.has_key('dragonfly_release') == True:\n    init_check = False\n    print \"You should first let Drafgonfly fly...\"\n    ghenv.Component.AddRuntimeMessage(gh.GH_RuntimeMessageLevel.Warning, \"You should first let Drafgonfly fly...\")\nelse:\n    if not sc.sticky['dragonfly_release'].isCompatible(ghenv.Component): init_check = False\n    if sc.sticky['dragonfly_release'].isInputMissing(ghenv.Component): init_check = False\n    df_PavementPar = sc.sticky[\"dragonfly_PavementPar\"]\n\nif init_check == True:\n    pavement_par = df_PavementPar(_albedo_, _thickness_, _conductivity_, \n        _vol_heat_cap_)",
