  "question": "I have a dimension style that I named “Ringo”. When I use the CurrentDimStyle method in Python it is returning this:\n\n\nfunction CurrentDimStyle at 0x000000000000002B\n\n\nCan someone check this and see if it is broken or is it me doing something wrong?\n\n\nHere is the code:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nstrDimStyle = rs.CurrentDimStyle\n\nprint strDimStyle\n\n\nYou could also test this (and see the same results):\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nprint rs.CurrentDimStyle\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDan",
