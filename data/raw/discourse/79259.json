  "question": "The following looks more intuitive (to me at least):\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nsel_point = rs.GetPoint(\"sel point:\")\npoint_from_guid = rs.coerce3dpoint(sel_point)\npt_coord_list = rs.GetPointCoordinates(point_from_guid)\n\n#guid as input could also be acceptable\npt_coord_list = rs.GetPointCoordinates(sel_point) \n\n\n\nBefore anyone answers with RhinoCommon examples. I kind of want to avoid RhinoCommon in this particular case.\n\nRhinoCommon api is not noob-friendly.",
