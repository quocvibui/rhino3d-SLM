  "question": "I’m trying to run a python script to check wether the count of iterations of the Kangaroo solver has changed within a specific time frame.\n\n\nThe idea behind that is to have a component that indicates wether a Kangaroo solver is running or not. I want to use that component in an algortihm with several Kangaroo solvers, so that I don’t have to turn them individually on and off everytime I’m changing something at the beginning.\n\nI cannot let them run as the file is quite heavy, thus I run them seperately.\n\n\nSo I did some research on Python and wrote the following code:\n\n\nimport time\n\ns = 1.0\n\ndef check():\n    prev_x = None\n    while True:\n        if prev_x != x:\n            print(\"False\")\n        else:\n            print(\"True\")\n        prev_x = x\n        time.sleep(s)\n        return prev_x\n\ncheck()\n\n\n\nUnfortunately its not working as the output does not change between True and False when I start or stop the solver.\n\n\nYet, I’m a bloody beginenr in Python so maybe someone with more expertise could help ?\n\nThanks in advance !\n\n\nkangaroo_python_test.gh\n (24.2 KB)",
