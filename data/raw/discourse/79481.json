  "title": "Evaluate point doesn't label with cplane coordinates",
  "question": "@pascal\n\nI’m ashamed to say I’ve not used this command and its label function in any serious endeavor in all my years of Rhinoing. Now I need it and notice it doesn’t label with the cplane coordinates, but rather with world coordinates only. I need it to evaluate and label with the current cplane coordinates.\n\n\nIs there some hidden setting I’m missing?\n\n\nv5, last update.\n\n\nThank you for any tips.",
