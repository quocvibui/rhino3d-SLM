  "title": "Transparent Background? -ViewCaptureToFile",
  "question": "Hello, I am working on a python script that is supposed to make a image for the current view, then hide the current layer, show the next layer and repeat. I was having difficulty with the Rhino.Command(-_Print) and had read that it had known bugs, so the only resources I could find were for the Rhino.Command(-_ViewCaptureToFile). The script seems to be working as intended, the view capture file is accepting my naming convention and going into the right path, but the background is grey and I can’t seem to get the command to accept an input that would change its value. Does anyone know how I can implement Transparent backgrounds, or an alternative method of saving my images to a folder for printing?\n\n\nThe current code I am using for the ViewCaptureToFile is:\n\n“rs.Command(’-_ViewCaptureToFile ‘+chr(34)+Result+i+’.png’+chr(34)+’ _Enter’)”\n\n\nThank you to everyone in advance!!",
