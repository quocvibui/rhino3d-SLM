  "title": "SyntaxError in saved scripts, but not untitled/unsaved scripts",
  "question": "I’m having trouble executing scripts on my machine.\n\n\nYesterday I started doing a \ntutorial\n with a generative rhino script.\n\nI could execute scripts, debug them, step in and over. But once I saved the file the scripts would no longer execute.\n\n\nWhen I run the script I get the following error:\n\n\n    G:\\1\n     ^\nSyntaxError: unexpected token ':'\n\n\n\nthe script is saved on drive G in folder “G:\\1) Documents\\ … \\scriptname.py”\n\nSo I can see why it’s saying G:\\1. I just can’t for the life of me figure out why it would not run scripts saved in particular locations, or why it would say the error is on line 1.\n\n\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\n\n\n\n\nAdding the folder to the Module Search Paths list (doesn’t work when it is, also doesn’t work when it isn’t )\n\n\nRestarting Rhino\n\n\nRestarting Windows\n\n\nCopy pasting the code in a new untitled file (does work!)\n\n\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\n\n\n\nRhino is installed on the C:\\ drive\n\n\nRhino version: Version 6 SR12 (6.12.19029.6381, 1/29/2019)",
