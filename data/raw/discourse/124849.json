  "title": "DelaunayMesh component fails from python in Version 6 SR34 / Version 7 SR6",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nThis is a minimal example showing how the DelaunayMesh component is no longer working correctly from Python (_EditPythonScript context) in current versions of Rhino 6 (Version 6 SR34) and 7. I have tested this on more than one installation, have restarted, etc.\n\n\nResult:\n\n“Warning: Delaunay Mesh: solver component. warning: Triangulation resulted in an empty mesh”\n\n\nThis used to work correctly in previous versions for Rhino 6. (I have a project that was worked on for months that uses this. Looks like the last mod date was May 28, 2020.)\n\n\nPlease advise; we need to spin up this project again. Thank you.\n\n\n\nimport  ghpythonlib.components as ghc\nfrom    Rhino.Geometry import Point3d\n\ndef delaunayMeshTest():\n    pts = [ Point3d(0,1,2), Point3d(4,5,6), Point3d(7,8,9) ]\n    print( \"len(pts): \" + str( len(pts) ) )\n    mesh = ghc.DelaunayMesh( pts )\n    print( \"mesh: \" + str( mesh ) )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    delaunayMeshTest()",
