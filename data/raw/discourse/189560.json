  "title": "What is Rhino.Geometry.Point3d[]",
  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nI am using rs.ProjectPointToSurface and it is returning a\n Rhino.Geometry.Point3d[]\n object.\n\nIt does not act like a list because object[0] causes an error.\n\nIt does not act like a Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object because object.X() causes an error.  So it is completely unusable.  This code used to work in version 7 but not is version 8.\n\n\nHere is a chunk of code with an abundance of print statements:\n\n\nRhino Error 1\n755×312 16.4 KB\n\n\nHere are the print statements:\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like this \nRhino.Geometry.Point3d[]\n  object is some mystery object that doesn’t act like anything usable.\n\n\nAm I missing something obvious?\n\n\nHenry",
