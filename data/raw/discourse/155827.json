  "title": "Irregular Parametric Dome",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\nI am learning Grasshopper and recently followed a tutorial to model\n\n\nJust dome.gh\n (32.6 KB)\n\na parametric dome. I am now trying to adjust the dome to an irregular shape that I can control, but I am having issues generating the 3D surface. I have tried using the Patch command, but I guess I am doing it wrong. I am attaching a screenshot of the geometry I am looking for (more or less) and the code. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time!\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-03-04 at 16.41.18\n1350×876 111 KB",
