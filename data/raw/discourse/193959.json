  "title": "Equilateral triangle dome",
  "question": "Hi!\n\n\nI have a module for an equilateral triangle that I want to use to create a geodesic dome. The dome doesn’t need to be perfect; a jagged appearance is acceptable. The same for the height, it does not need to be the same for the radius either.\n\n\nI’d like to know how to construct a geodesic dome in Grasshopper with a fixed triangle size. My goal is for the triangle size to remain constant even as I change the dome’s radius. However, I realize that I can’t simply use a slider to adjust the radius, since not all values will correspond to an integer multiple of my module size. Instead, I’ve compiled a list of specific radii that work well with my triangle size.\n\n\nIn the code is 3 ways I have tried, but it does not give the same triangle size for all.\n\n\nEquilateral triangle geodesic dome.gh\n (16.9 KB)\n\n\nCould you guide me on how to achieve this? Thank you!",
