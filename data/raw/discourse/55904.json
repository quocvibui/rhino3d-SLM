  "question": "If i have four curves in a layer, and i want to select two of them ( i need their object ids). These two have the longer lengths as opposed to the other ones, how should i go about it?\n\n\nI have already selected them all and i can produce a cumulative length. But i want to detect each length and than select the highest two. any idea?\n\n\nSorry bout the amateur post, but i am very new. A good explanation would help me learn as well as a sample.\n\nThanks.",
