  "title": "Best way to add control points to a curve?",
  "question": "I’m using ghpython to write a visitors’ path simulation.\n\nI have a timer that’s linked to the python component and it updates all the visitors’ positions and links their past points together to create paths (curves).\n\nThe code goes something like this:\n\n\n#for\n a single tourist, updates his/her position\n\ntourist.positionList.append(newPoint)\n\n\n#then\n update the curve\n\ntourist.trail = rs.AddPolyline(tourist.positionList)\n\n\nRight now I’m faced with the problem that I am adding an entirely new curve for every visitor per update, instead of updating the existing curve. It caused a lot of performance issues. I have tried different solutions including setting the trail to None, or using rs.DeleteObject and a couple of other things. None of them worked.\n\n\nThanks for reading and I will really appreciate it if you could offer some insight.",
