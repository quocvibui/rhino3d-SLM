Set 'False' to keep each component\n            (face) in the WUFI Model separate.\n        \n        _merge_faces: (bool | float [tolerance]) Default=False. Set 'True' to try and merge  \n            together touching faces in order to simplify the model. This operation can \n            somethimes have unexpected results with some geometry, so only use \n            it if you really need to reduce the complexity of the WUFI model and \n            be sure to careufully check the resulting model faces for errors. If you\n            have errors when merging, try passing in a different tolerance value here \n            (0.0001, 0.1, etc) and see if that helps.\n\n        _merge_spaces_by_erv: (bool) Default=False. Set 'True' to have the WUFI-XML\n            report out the spaces as 'merged' elements. In the WUFI \"Rooms Ventilation\"\n            section there will be only a single 'room' entry for each ERV. This is \n            sometimes requested by Phiue when reviewing a project for Certification.\n            Best practice is to leave it 'False' and to report out all the detailed\n            rooms one at a time.\n\n        _merge_exhaust_vent_devices: (bool) Default=False. Set 'True' to have the WUFI-XML\n            report out the exhaust-ventilation (fans, kitchen hoods) 'merged' by type in order\n            to simplify and shorten the WUFI-model. \n\n        _generate_log_files: (int) Default=0.
