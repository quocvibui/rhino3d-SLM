  "question": "Hello everyone,\n\n\nI’m dealing with fonts on macOS, and I’m trying to load a list of system fonts to choose from.\n\n\nInitially I was using the “off-the-shelf” \nEto.forms.FontDialog\n.\n\nThis dialog is presented as a \nsemi-modal window\n, while I wanted a \nmodal\n dialog that explicitly asks the user to choose a font and then gets out of the way.\n\nSo I implemented a custom Font Dialog that uses the \nEto.Drawing.Fonts.AvailableFontFamilies\n property which I expect  - as stated in the documentation - to return\n\n\n\n\nan enumeration of available font families in the current system\n\n\n\n\nSo this is what I get:\n\n\nScreenshot 2026-02-02 at 15.40.02\n1540×1804 279 KB\n\n\nBut the list of fonts retrieved are different from the one in the \nEto.forms.FontDialog\n:\n\n\nScreenshot 2026-02-02 at 15.43.42\n1191×642 188 KB\n\n\nMoreover, I was expecting the list of fonts to reflect the files I can find on the Mac at location \n/System/Library/Fonts\n or \n/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental\n, (or at least the ones with \n*.ttf\n extension) but actually there are some fonts in those folders that are not picked up by either solutions.\n\n\nI just wanted to know if the “available fonts” are retrieved from those locations and which logic is used to filter them.\n\nHas any of you ever had experiences with loading and using fonts in Eto Apps?\n\nIs there a “best practice” to follow?\n\n\nThanks for any suggestion",
