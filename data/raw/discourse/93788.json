  "title": "Move to certain coordinate one one or two axes, without changing the other coordinates",
  "question": "Hello,\n\nIs there a way to move an object using world coordinates, but leaving some axis coordinates the same?\n\nExample: Moving an object from (12.56, 5.22, 2.14) to (12.56, 5.22, 8).\n\nI guess typing something similar to (-,-,8).\n\n\nBeing the first time that I have to write a question, I want to thank you guys for being such an awesome community, and spending so much of your time helping other people. You have saved me many times over the years.",
