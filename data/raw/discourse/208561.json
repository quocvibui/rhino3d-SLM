  "question": "Hi, is there a way in Rhino 8 where I can figure out what named views are selected in the Named Views panel?\n\n\nI am working on a small render script and this would be a cool way to choose frames from.\n\n\nimage\n408×494 34.5 KB\n\n\nI found this thread from 2019 that says it isn’t possible, but has anything changed in UI accessibility since then \n@dale\n ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet selected named views\n \nRhino Developer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Hi \n@maito78\n, \nThere isn’t any way of accessing the panel’s selected named view - sorry. \n– Dale",
