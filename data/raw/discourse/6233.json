  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nAt last I have some time to pick up on RhinoPython.\n\nMy current challenge: set text to display a detail scale.\n\nWhat I have so far already halts after selecting a detail.\n\nCan anyone help to show me on how to approach this, furthermore any reading to prevent me asking apparent beginners questions like this.\n\n\nThanks\n\n-Willem\n\n\nWhat I have so far:\n\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino\ndef DetailScaleToText():\n    # Get the detail\n    DetailID = rs.GetObject(\"Select Detail for scale\", rs.filter.detail, True, False)\n    if( DetailID==None ): return\n    \n    # I understand that DetailID is now a System.GUID\n    # But how to go about getting the ration of that Detail it refers to\n    # per Rhino.Geometry.DetailView.PageToModelRatio\n    \n    DetailObject = ?\n    \n    ratio = DetailObject.PageToModelRatio\n    print ratio\n\n\n    \n# Check to see if this file is being executed as the \"main\" python\n# script instead of being used as a module by some other python script\n# This allows us to use the module which ever way we want.\nif( __name__ == \"__main__\" ):\n    DetailScaleToText()",
