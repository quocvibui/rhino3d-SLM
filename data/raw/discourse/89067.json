  "title": "Automatically recomputing dictionaries in GHPython",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI have data stored in a dictionary and for every parameter change instead of the dictionary to update automatically, I have to manually recompute. Is this from my end or is this a known issue?\n\n\nWhat my example file attached is trying to do is loop through empty word lists and fill them with characters relative to the word size and size of the given characters (sliders). When you adjust the sliders, it doesn’t update the output till you recompute.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n1360×735 53.9 KB\n\n\n \ndictionary issues.gh\n (7.2 KB)\n\n\nThanks",
