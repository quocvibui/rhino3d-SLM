  "question": "I have kind of a dumb idea and I speculate that the quickest route to testing it out would be to somehow just capture everything going on in the command line in realtime (and then do something something.)  Is that…possible, is there an event I can just hook in to? Otherwise I’d have to, I dunno, roll my own command line, which I suppose is what I’d eventually have to do but sounds pretty daunting…",
