  "title": "Closing viewports",
  "question": "Hello,\n\nI wonder if there is any method for closing viewports? I have some scripts for cleaning and managing documents generated from some other models, like removing unwanted entities and so on. And also I feel cravings for having one and single viewport in some of these documents… Is it possible, with Python or Rhinoscript? I see there are lots of methods for handling views, but none of them seems to close a viewport… And I see there is a bit messing with views and viewports, I think it could be handled a bit more people friendly \n\n\nI still use Rhino 6, but I am almost ready to move to Rhino 8.\n\n\nCheers, Jaro",
