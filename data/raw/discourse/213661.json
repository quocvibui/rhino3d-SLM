  "question": "Over the years, I’ve often struggled with connecting VSCode to Rhino/GH’s Python setup.\n\nThere are many posts here in this community, since I’m still a beginner myself, so I wrote this mainly as documentation for my own learning from the community.\n\nBut I’m sharing it here in case it helps anyone who’s going through the same confusion.\n\n\nThis is a very elementary introduction of how to use \nVSCode to write code and run it in Grasshopper\n.\n\n\nIf you spot any mistakes or have better ideas, please feel free to share — I’m learning too, and it would be great to grow together with the community.\n\n\n\n\n[!] Forget about plugins for now. They are great, but let’s use native functions — I believe this helps us set up the right mindset.\n\n\n\n\nWhy use VSCODE\n\n\nCopilot, autocomplete, and smarter IntelliSense.\n\n\nCPython\n\n\nEnvironments in Rhino/Grasshopper\n\n\nRhino/Grasshopper has its own interpreter — that’s what we’ve been using inside Rhino and Grasshopper for script editing.\n\n\nThey locates in \nMcNeel\\Rhinoceros\\8.0\\scripts\n\n\nI guess Rhino handles C# and Python differently behind the scenes — C# scripts are compiled, while Python uses an interpreter. But for this post, let’s focus only on Python\n\n\nIn this thread (as \n@Mahdiyar\n shows):\n\n\nRhino 8 How to use input code in Grasshopper script component - Scripting - McNeel Forum\n\n\nThere are 3 modes in the GH scripting component.\n\nThe third one shows how you can link an external script file and run it in Grasshopper.\n\n\n251215_GH scripting with VSCODE-1\n765×603 38 KB\n\n\nshift + right click\n on the component and there is an option to turn on \nScript Input Parameter\n\n\n251215_GH scripting with VSCODE\n665×579 23.7 KB\n\n\nIf you want the component to auto-switch language, add a \nShebang\n at the top of your file.\n\nRhino reads this to decide how to parse the script.\n\n\n//#! csharp\n\n\n\n#! python\n\n\n\nStubs\n\n\n\n\n[b] \nWriting and Maintaining Stub Files — typing documentation\n\n\n\n\nWhat are stubs?\n\nThey are like a \ntable of contents\n for a library.\n\nThey usua...",
