  "question": "Hi,\n\nI have a procedure that turns 1D lines into 2D rectangles (both in the x-y plane). Where the lines intersect the curve-boolean is used. The results are shown in the attached file.\n\nLines1/Boolean1 have a separation of 0.003 units compared to Lines2/Booelan2 which is 0.005 units.\n\nThe last step is to create a planar surface with the command PlanarSrf. Here is where I come across the problem. For some reason the PlanarSrf command thinks there is a self-intersecting object in Boolean1 but doesn’t have a problem in Boolean2.\n\nHas this got anything to do with unit tolerance? Is there a way of solving this?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nIssue.3dm\n (64.2 KB)",
