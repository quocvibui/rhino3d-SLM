  "question": "I have problem while doing Boolean difference of two solids in Python scripting component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I use  \ndifference = rs.BooleanDifference(Box, Spheres)\n  then the error is “Runtime error(NullReferenceException): Object reference not set to an instance of an object”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I use \ndifference = Rhino.Geometry.Brep.CreateBooleanDifference(Box, Spheres, 0.01)\n then the error is “Runtime error(ArgumentTypeException): expected Brep, got Guid”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if I take the output of Box and Spheres and input them to a different Python scripting component and perform the 1st method then it works fine. Also using SolidDifference component \n\n\nBooleanDifference_Problem\n1941×515 141 KB\n\n\n \nRandom Pores in 3D 1.gh\n (7.3 KB) works fine.\n\n\nPlease help me with this.\n\n\nThank you !",
