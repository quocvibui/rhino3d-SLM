  "title": "Marking Camera Position",
  "question": "We can show camera positions, one at a time, and store them as Named Views and recall them from that list.\n\n\nI am marking each one on the plan as I set it up, snapping to the Viewpoint the point of a small cone in a block also containing text to match the camera number so someone can point at that Camera position and ask “What does it look like from there?”\n\n\nIs there a more efficient way to store some portion of the Camera View icon itself? Something that automatically displayed the lens length would be good. I bet a Grassshopper could do it.",
