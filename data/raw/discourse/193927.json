  "title": "Run code on plugin load",
  "question": "Is it possible to have code running globally on a Grasshopper plugin which would trigger when the plugin is active? For example, a static class which subscribes to some events of the rhino document or grasshopper canvas and lives throughout the lifetime of the plugin regardless of any of the components/parameters actually being placed in a Grasshopper document?",
