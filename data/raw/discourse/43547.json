  "question": "Looking for a better way to do this:\n\n\nI’m trying to create a Toolbar Menu Dropdown with preset layers. I have about 100 of these buttons, each loading just one layer of choice.\n\n\nCurrently, I’m using Rhino Buttons within the toolbar to run python scipts with \n-_RunPythonScript somefile.py 0\n where the integer is then passed into the script with \nrs.GetInteger\n and then executes whichever function is associated with that integer.\n\n\nThough this is working, I’m interested to see if theres a more efficient way of doing this. Preferably, one that does not add \nText: 0\n to the command line each time.",
