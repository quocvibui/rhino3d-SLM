  "title": "GetObjects not selecting VA Objects",
  "question": "Hi VisualArq Team,\n\n\nI had previously attempted to write some of my own VA commands but had just discovered that for some reason GetObject() does not allow for the selection of VA objects.\n\n\nThis is the behavior that I am facing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n831×645 38.2 KB\n\n\nI am just trying to run a simple script of GetObject() using the native rhino python editor  but this does not seem to be working as intended. Any idea what is going on here?\n\n\nThank you.",
