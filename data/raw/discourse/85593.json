  "question": "I know there is the possibility to execute scripts when Rhino \nopens\n. \n*\n\nWhat I want is to execute a script every time I open a file.\n\nIs this already possible and I’m just overlooking it?\n\n\n(Possibly not.)\n\nBefore somebody asks, why on earth I’d want this feature \n:\n\nI want to open any associated Grasshopper file [if existing] to a Rhino file – and as good programmer I am lazy \n\n\nThinking about it: maybe a button with a script is just good enough. \n**",

Scripted in a way so it only works when opening .3dm files and \n            the Grasshopper definition needs to rest in the same folder.\n            This could be changed – if you want to adjust this :)\n    Caveat! This script can't do anything when Rhino is not already open \n            and you double-click open a Rhino file.\n            That's a limitation which I doubt can be overcome...\n\"\"\"\n\nimport Rhino\nimport scriptcontext",
