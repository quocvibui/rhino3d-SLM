  "question": "Hello,\n\nI am new in Python.\n\nI am trying to find the distance between each vertex and its neighbours.\n\nI access neighbours of each vertex with list(M.Vertices.GetVertexNeighbours(i))\n\nHowever, I could not access the point coordinates of each neighbour by writing M.Vertices.GetVertexNeighbours(i[0])\n\nCould you suggest me a way to get a list of point coordinates of each neighbour?\n\n\n\n\npython-gh-help\n1536×650 83.5 KB",
