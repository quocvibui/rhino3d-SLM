  "question": "Slowly picking up RhinoPython, like again…Really appreciate for the help!\n\nit is a basic question while trying to read the McNeel tutorial, about the “Conditional Evaluation - if”:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nsomenumber = rs.GetReal(“Line length”)\n\nline = rs.AddLine( (0,0,0), (somenumber,0,0) )\n\nif line is None:\n\nprint(“Something went wrong”)\n\nelse:\n\nprint(“Line curve inserted with id”, line)\n\n\nQuestion: if I type in “0”, it will stop immediately after line 3 with the traceback “Unable to add line to document”,\n\n\nASK:\n\nIs there a way for me to bypass this “null” data, and keep going to the “if” statement.\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\nCheers,\n\nRan",
