  "title": "Reading object display color in Grasshopper",
  "question": "How do I go about learning the object color set in rhino from grasshopper?\n\n\nI have a bunch of surfaces in a 3d model that have been coded in various colors and I’d like to use this information in my grasshopper script, but how do I go about this?\n\n\nA supplementary question is how to use the new Rhino filter components to select the surfaces based on these colors…\n\n\nI feel both thinks must be super easy, but I just can’t figure it out…so any suggestion would be welcome\n\n\nthanks",
