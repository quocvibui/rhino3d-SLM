  "title": "RhinoCommon equivalent to Blend command",
  "question": "Hi, I would like to know what is the RhinoCommon method that is equivalent to the Blend command in Rhino? I mean the Blend command used to create a curve connecting two curves (the “quick” version). I initially thought it was Curve.CreateBlendCurve, but after trying a while, I can’t produce the same curve. That method produces a curve more like the Connect command. I want a smooth, curvature-continuous curve like the one the Blend does.\n\nCan someone help me?\n\nThanks,\n\nIlidio.",
