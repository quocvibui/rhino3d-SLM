  "question": "Hi,\n\nI wanted to get geometry details(programatically) such as coordinates of a point/object by passing guid of that object. Please help me with solution\n\n\nNote:\n\nI am using Rhino6 and \ngrasshopper is \nnot used\n here\n, also its appreciated if the solution provided doesn’t use grasshopper",
