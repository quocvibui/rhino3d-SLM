The fractional values will get multiplied by the _watts\n            to yield a complete process load profile.\n        \n        _fuel_type: (str) Text to denote the type of fuel consumed by the Appliance. Using the\n            \"None\" type indicates that no end uses will be associated with the\n            Appliance, only the zone gains.

For example, “Cooking”,\n            “Clothes Drying”, etc. (Default: General).\n        \n        radiant_fract_: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total\n            appliance load given off as long wave radiant heat. (Default: 0).\n        \n        latent_fract_: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total\n            appliance load that is latent (as opposed to sensible). (Default: 0).\n        \n        lost_fract_: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total\n            appliance load that is lost outside of the zone and the HVAC system.\n            Typically, this is used to represent heat that is exhausted directly\n            out of a zone (as you would for a stove).
