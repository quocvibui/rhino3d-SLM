  "title": "Issue while writing values from ghpython to csv",
  "question": "Hello!\n\n\nI am trying to write point coordinates, more specifically the xcoordinate value and the y coordinate value to a CSV file from GHpython.\n\n\nI am rounding the coordinate values by 2 decimals and then writing them to separate columns, but on opening the file some values have not taken the decimal correction. I do not understand why this happens. my code is attached below and an image of the CSV file output. Any suggestion would be very helpful! thanks in advance\n\n\nimport Rhino as rc\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\n\nfileName = open(fileAddress, 'w')\nfor pt in points: \n    \n    a = round(pt.X,2)\n    b = round(pt.Y,2)\n\n    fileName.write(`a` + ';' + `b`+ '\\n')\n    \nfileName.close()\n\n\n\n\n\n000\n420×583 74 KB",
