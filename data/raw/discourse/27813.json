  "title": "How to join 2 circles into a \"snowman\"?",
  "question": "I’m trying to do something which I think should be really simple.\n\n\nWith python, I want to create 2 circles that overlap, like a snowman, create their surfaces, and then merge the 2 surfaces into one surface I can extrude.\n\n\nI tried this:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs;\ncir1 = rs.AddCircle([0,0,0], 10);\ncir2 = rs.AddCircle([0,10,0], 5);\ncir1Srf = rs.AddPlanarSrf(cir1);\ncir2Srf = rs.AddPlanarSrf(cir2);\nsnow = rs.BooleanUnion([cir1Srf, cir2Srf])\n\n\n\nBut the “BooleanUnion” seems to be acting more like a “BooleanIntersection”.     If I extrude the area it created with:\n\nline = rs.AddLine([0,0,0], [0,0,10])\n\nsolid1 = rs.ExtrudeSurface(snow, line)\n\n\nIt looks like:\n\n\n\n\nI was expecting the whole “snowman” to be extruded.   I want it to look like this (which I created manually with trims and splits, etc.  Not with a script):\n\n\n\n\nThere’s obviously something I don’t understand in joining 2 circles.  I’m new to Rhino.\n\n\nThanks for any help.",
