  "title": "Rhinoscriptsyntax PopupMenu() bug - incorrect position with 4K screens",
  "question": "rs.PopupMenu() is \nsupposed\n to pop up under the cursor position if no optional position argument is supplied.\n\n\nimage\n728×263 6.51 KB\n\n\nI have a desktop with two HD (1920 x 1200) monitors (extended desktop), and it works correctly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, on my laptop with a 4K screen (225% scaling, 250 is recommended) it is far from correct…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomehow, this is not being interpreted correctly in this case\n\n\nscreen_point = System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Position\n\n\nIt may be that the display scaling is causing the problem, but as this is common on 4K screen setups, it does need to work.\n\n\nYou can run this code to test if you like (under a button or from the script editor)\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\ncl=[\"egg\", \"bacon\", \"sausage\", \"baked beans\", \"spam\"]\nchoice=rs.PopupMenu(cl)\n\n\n\nThis is happening in both V6 and the current V7 Beta (to me anyway)",
