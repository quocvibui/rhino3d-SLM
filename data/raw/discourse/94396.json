  "question": "Hello guys,\n\n\nI am trying to script in ghpython that is able to preview the leader (arrow, curve and text), instead of directly bake the leader object in Rhino.\n\n\nThe following script is my attempt. I did create the leader object, but it is not previewing in Rhino.\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\nimport Rhino\n\nptts = Rhino.Collections.Point3dList(x)\ndim = Rhino.RhinoDoc.ActiveDoc.DimStyles[0]\napts = Rhino.Collections.Point3dList.ToArray(ptts)\n\nleader = rg.Leader.Create(\"test\", y, dim, apts)\na = leader\n\n\n\nAny help will be great! Thanks in advance.\n\n\nleader_preview.gh\n (7.2 KB)",
