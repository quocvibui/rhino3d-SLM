This is useful if you are calculating interior net-floor-area or volume \nas in the Passive House models. Each Space will map to a single entry in the WUFI \n'Ventilation Rooms' or a PHPP 'Additional Ventilation'.\n-\nA single Space is made of one or more 'Volumes'. ie: a bedroom might have a volume for \nthe main space, and another volume for the closet which is separated by the thicknes of \na wall. \n-\nEach Volume is made of one or more floor-segments. Each floor-segment can have a\n'weighting factor' applied for calculating the TFA/iCFA for Passive House certification.\n-\nEM June 25, 2024\n    Args:\n        _flr_seg_geom: (Tree[Geometry]) The Rhino geometry that you would like to use \n            to create the Floor-Segments of the various Spaces. Each branch should be a list \n            of Rhino geometry objects that will be used to create a single new Space.\n        \n        _weighting_factors: (Tree[float]) An optional input Tree of TFA/iCFA weighting\n            factors to apply to the input floor-segment geometry.\n        \n        _volume_heights: (Tree[float]) Default=2.5m An optional input Tree of heights\n            to use when building the volume geometry.\n        \n        _volume_geometry: (Tree[Geometry]) An optional input Tree of Rhino Geometry\n            describing the space-shape of the individual volumes. \n        \n        _space_names: (Tree[float]) Default=\"_Unnamed_\" An optional input Tree of names\n            to use when building the spaces\n        \n        _space_numbers: Default=\"000\" An optional input Tree of space numbers\n            to use when building the spaces\n\n        _space_ph_vent_rates: (Tree[SpacePhVentFlowRates]) An optional tree of detailed\n            PH-Style space-level fresh air ventilaton flow rate objets. These can be created\n            using the \"HBPH - Create Space PH Ventilation\" component or gotten directly \n            from the Rhino scene using the \"HBPH - Get FloorSegment Data\" component.\n\n        _flr_seg_net_area: (Tree[float]) Optional input for 'net' (interior) floor area\n            for the floor-segments. This 'net' area is used for the Phius Multifamily calculator\n            since they insist on using net-area instead for that calculator, but gross area\n            for their iCFA, but only for the non-residential zones like hallways. The\n            input data here (branches, items, ...) should ideally match the structure of the\n            the '_flr_seg_geometry' input. In none is input, the area of the '_flr_seg_geometry'\n            will be used for both the gross and net floor areas.\n    \n    Returns:\n        floor_breps_: Preview of the Space Floor geometry created. Useful for debugging.\n        \n        volume_breps_: Preview of the Space Volume geometry created. Useful for debugging.\n        \n        spaces_: The new PH-Spaces created. These can be added to Honeybee-Rooms.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Rhino as rh\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport ghpythonlib.components as ghc\nimport Grasshopper as gh\n\nfrom honeybee_ph_rhino import gh_io, gh_compo_io\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_\nreload(honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_)\nghenv.Component.Name = \"HBPH - Create Spaces\"\nDEV = honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_.set_component_params(ghenv, dev=False)\nif DEV:\n    from honeybee_ph_rhino.gh_compo_io import space_create_spc as gh_compo_io\n    from honeybee_ph_rhino.make_spaces import make_floor, make_floor_segment\n    from honeybee_ph import space\n    reload(space)\n    reload(make_floor_segment)\n    reload(make_floor)\n    reload(gh_compo_io)\n    reload(gh_io)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nif _volume_geometry.BranchCount != 0:\n    msg = \" Sorry - Detailed input using '_volume_geometry' is not \"\\\n            \"implemented just yet.
