  "title": "What script function to select a group of points by point cloud or mouse click & drag",
  "question": "Hi, I just started Python and am using this script that draws circles around points.\n\n\npoints = rs.GetPoints(“Pick points”)\n\nradius = rs.GetInteger(“What’s the radius?”)\n\n\nfor point in points:\n\nrs.AddCircle(point, radius)\n\n\nHowever, I’d like it to allow me to select the points either by point cloud or by grouping using the mouse click & drag function. Currently, the script requires me to select these points individually by mouse click. Any help would be much appreciated.",
