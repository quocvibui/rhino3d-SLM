  "title": "Panels.OpenPanel acts differently on mac",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nFor our plugin we are adding a panel for some additional information, which works perfect on windows in Rhino 8.\n\n\nHowever when building the plugin for mac the command used for opening the panel does not open the panel as on windows. It never becomes visible.\n\n\nWhat am I missing here? I’ve looked through the documentation but maybe I’m misunderstanding something.\n\n\nThe code for opening the panel is here:\n\n\nprotected override Result RunCommand( Rhino.RhinoDoc doc, RunMode mode )\n{\n  var panelId = typeof(MyCommand.MyCustomPanel).GUID;\n  var visible = Panels.IsPanelVisible(panelId);\n\n  if (!visible)\n  {\n    Panels.OpenPanel(panelId);\n    RhinoApp.WriteLine(\"The panel should open.\");\n    return Result.Success;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    RhinoApp.WriteLine(\"The panel is already open.\");\n    return Result.Nothing;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nI’m pretty sure the panel is registered correct as I see the debugging line after the OpenPanel call in the above code snippet.\n\n\nI hope to be pointed in the right direction…\n\n\nBest regards, Maiken",
