  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nI have made an object using Grasshopper and baked the model using \nbake objects\n component. What I am trying to do, as a next step is that I am trying to \nexport\n the baked model as .iges file from Rhino using a rhino python script.\n\n\nThe code I am currently having is this\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\ndef ExportIGESFile():\n\nfilter=“IGES files|.igs||”\n\nfilename=rs.SaveFileName(“Iges export”,filter)\n\nif not filename: return\t\t\n\nrs.Command(\"_-Export “+chr(34)+filename+chr(34)+” _Enter\",False)\n\nExportIGESFile()\n\n\nThis coding is NOT able to choose the baked model, I still manually have to choose the baked model before running the script.\n\n\nwhat code should I add to make the baked model automatically chosen and export as an iges file?\n\n\nRegards",
