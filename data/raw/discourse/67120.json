  "question": "I’m accessing rhinocommon mostly through ironpython\n\nCan someone tell me what data types are mutable and what not?\n\nI’m guessing Point3d is immutable like an integer. A brep is probably mutable like a python dictionary. Is that right? what about curves, planes, lines, box, etc…?",
