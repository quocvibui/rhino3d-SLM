  "question": "I don’t expect this to gather a lot of support, but many of the RhinoScriptSyntax functions use/return Point3d objects and they can’t be compared to None.\n\n\nimport Rhino.Geometry as rg\nImportantPoint = rg.Point3d(1,2,3)\nif ImportantPoint == None:\n    print('Not Defined Yet')\n\n\n\nComplains that\n\n\n\n\nTypeError: No method matches given arguments for Point3d.op_Equality: (<class ‘NoneType’>)\n\n\n\n\nInstead of setting the default value of my objects to None, I thought I would create an “empty” Point3d object and then use the IsValid to see if it is defined yet.  But that doesn’t work because even an empty Point3d is still valid because it defaults to the origin.\n\n\nQ = rg.Point3d()\nprint(Q.IsValid)  <- True\n\n\n\nBack to the old try:except block",
