This Phius Program will determine the lighting, MEL, and occupancy based on the \nnumber of bedrooms, the number of total dwelling units, and the total iCFA (interior conditioned\nfloor area). This component takes in a base-program and will modify the lighting, MEL, and occupancy\nloads only. For most Phius-REVIVE projects, you should use the default program from the REVIVE\nstandards library. You can load this default program using the \"Load REVIVE Program from Standards\"\ngrasshopper component, and pass it in as the _base_program.\n-\nFor more information on how these values are calculated, see the Phius Manual(s) or:\nhttps://codes.iccsafe.org/content/RESNET3012014P1/4-home-energy-rating-calculation-procedures-\n-\nEM October 1, 2024\n    Args:\n        _total_icfa: (float) The total Interio-Conditioned-Floor-Area of the entire building\n            area being simulated.\n\n        _total_number_dwellings: (int) The total number of dwelling units in the entire building\n            area being simulated.\n\n        _total_number_bedrooms: (int) The total number of bedrooms in the entire building\n            area being simulated.\n\n        _base_program: (ProgramType) A base program of loads and schedules to use as the \n            starting point for the new Phius-REVIVE Residential Program. In most cases you\n            should use the default program provided in the Honeybee-REVIVE-Standards, but you \n            can also provided your own custom schedule to use as the base.\n\n    Returns:\n        hb_energy_program_: (ProgramType | None) The Honeybee-Energy Program with the Lighting, \n            MEL, and occupancy values assigned baseed on the attributes provided. \n\"\"\"\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Rhino as rh\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport ghpythonlib.components as ghc\nimport Grasshopper as gh\n\ntry:\n    from ph_gh_component_io import gh_io\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    raise ImportError('\\nFailed to import ph_gh_component_io:\\n\\t{}'.format(e))\n\ntry:\n    from honeybee_revive_rhino import gh_compo_io\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    raise ImportError('\\nFailed to import honeybee_revive_rhino:\\n\\t{}'.format(e))\n\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport honeybee_revive_rhino._component_info_\nreload(honeybee_revive_rhino._component_info_)\nghenv.Component.Name = \"HB-REVIVE - Create REVIVE Residential Program\"\nDEV = honeybee_revive_rhino._component_info_.set_component_params(ghenv, dev=False)\nif DEV:\n    from honeybee_revive_rhino.gh_compo_io.standards import create_revive_residential_program as gh_compo_io\n    reload(gh_compo_io)\n    \n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# -- GH Interface\nIGH = gh_io.IGH( ghdoc, ghenv, sc, rh, rs, ghc, gh )\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ngh_compo_interface = gh_compo_io.GHCompo_CreateReviveResidentialProgram(\n        IGH,\n        _total_icfa,\n        _total_number_dwellings,\n        _total_number_bedrooms,\n        _base_program,\n)\nhb_energy_program_ = gh_compo_interface.run()\nprint hb_energy_program_",
