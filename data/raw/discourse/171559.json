  "question": "All is well when working with \nRhino.Geometry\n data types, but creating a \nlist\n messes everything up:\n\n\nScript\n3075×1660 204 KB\n\n\nListOutputIssue.gh\n (13.0 KB)\n\n\n\n\nSame result when using \nrhinoscriptsyntax\n.\n\n\nIt won’t help to change the output data type.\n\n\nThis happens for most Rhino.Geometry data types, including Point3d, Vector3d, Line, …\n\n\nThis happens in \nC#\n, \nPython3\n and \nIronpython2\n\n\n\n\nSo I guess it has nothing to do with compilation, but rather with the way Script components handle these data types. \nThe Rhino.Geometry data types don’t get converted to Grasshopper data types, as far as I can tell.\n\n\nfrom Rhino.Geometry import Point3d\nfrom Grasshopper.Kernel.Types import GH_Point\na = [GH_Point(Point3d(0, 0, 0)), GH_Point(Point3d(1, 0, 0))]\n\n\n\nThere is no problem with this one.\n\n\n@eirannejad",
