  "question": "Hi guys,\n\n\nI used a python code in GH of Rhino 7 to read point files and export 3d points tree.\n\nIn the code, I used the componenet “ghpythonlib.treehelpers.list_to_tree” to transfer nested lists of poits into tree for next steps.\n\nHowever, when I use the same code in GH of Rhino 8, the output is a list of “Rhino.Collections.Point3dList” which I can’t use in GH.\n\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nThank you all so much!\n\n\nghissue\n2086×501 106 KB",
