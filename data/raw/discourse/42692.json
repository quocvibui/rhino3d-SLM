  "question": "Hello.\n\nI have been learning Rhino for Windows in a digital fabrication class and recently installed Rhino 5 on my MacBook Pro to try out the Mac version.\n\nI was hoping to use python to generate several interpolated curves from many data points.\n\nI have a decent amount of python experience for exactly this situation - not as a real developer, but I use it all the time for solving problems like this.\n\nHowever, after following the instructions to set up Atom with Rhino, I can’t run even a simple example script.\n\nThe Atom end appears to work fine (Rhino syntax autocompletion is working, RhinoPython appears in the packages menu), and I’m making sure that the Atom listener is running in Rhino. But every time I chose “Save and run in Rhino” from the Atom menu or use the ctrl+opt+R shortcut, I get an error in Rhino:\n\n\nException occurred\n\nMessage: ‘module’ object has no attribute ‘AddLine’ (or AddCircle or whatever)\n\n\nWhen I look at the info for both Rhino 5.3.2 and Rhino WIP, it tells me IronPython is not installed, but I thought this was supposed to be included with Rhino automatically?\n\n\nHere is more info:\n\nSoftware information\n\n\nSoftware versions\n\nRhinoceros version:  5.3.2  (5D197)\n\nIronPython version:  not installed\n\nEvaluation expiration:  June 27, 2017\n\nLanguage:  en-US (MacOS default)\n\nmacOS version:  Version 10.12.3 (Build 16D32)\n\n\nPlug-ins\n\nNone\n\n\nThird party kernel extensions\n\ncom.Cycling74.driver.Soundflower (2) 2D779840-7439-31E5-8A66-D786C3F47B75\n\n\nHardware information\n\n\nComputer hardware\n\nHardware model:  MacBookPro12,1\n\nProcessor:  Intel Core i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\n\nMemory:  16 GB\n\nArchitecture:  Intel 64 bit\n\n\nVideo hardware\n\nGraphics:  Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB\n\nMemory:  1536 MB\n\nScreen size:  1440 x 900\n\nDisplays:  Color LCD (256dpi 2x)\n\n\nUSB devices\n\nBroadcom Corp.: Bluetooth USB Host Controller\n\n\nBluetooth devices\n\nNone\n\n\nOpenGL information\n\n\nOpenGL software\n\nOpenGL version:  2.1 INTEL-10.22.29\n\nRender version:  2.1\n\nShading language:  1.20\n\nMax...",
