  "title": "_SelName from rs.GetObjects not returning expected results",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\nI wrote a rhinopython script where I use rs.GetObjects:\n\n\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nObj_Ids=rs.GetObjects(message=“Select objects”,filter=0)\n\n[…] other stuff\n\n\n\n\nDuring testing, when I’m asked to select objects, for ease of selection, I want to have the possibility of using _SelName.\n\nI tried, and _SelName pops the window up with objects’ names. However, when I select object by names from the window coming from _SelName, the output to the list Obj_Ids if often not correct.\n\n\nIn some cases objects ids appears twice. In some other cases I get ids of object which should not be in the list of selected objects, and they seems to be there only because they have a name which was temporarily clicked in the _selname window (right click, or shift+right click, or ctrl+right click), but which was not selected finally.  Duplicated ids would not be a big issue. But in some cases objects are selected which have a name not selected in the window from _selname.\n\n\nNote that direct selection of objects from the drawing, works perfectly. So the issue seems to be in the use of _selname.\n\n\nThe following script can be used to make a check:\n\n\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nObjIds=rs.GetObjects(message=“Select objects”,filter=0)\n\nprint(“Number of ids %d” % len(ObjIds))\n\nprint(“Number of unique ids %d” % len(list(set(ObjIds))))\n\n\nAm I doing something wrong, or is there actually something not working when calling _selname after rs.GetObjects ?\n\n\nThanks,\n\nGabriele",
