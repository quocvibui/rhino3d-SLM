I’m using ghpython to write some stuff but stuck at some silly bug…\n\n\nI’m trying to make my script as simple as I can, code is as followed. my input is a simple plane list (I specified the type list and plane), and I draw a circle.\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nfrom ghpythonlib import components as ghcomp\nimport scriptcontext as sc\n\nxo = x[0].Origin\nxz = x[0].ZAxis\na = ghcomp.CircleCNR(xo,xz,1)\nprint a\n\n\n\nthis works if I use gh battery directly, but in ghpython it returns None…\n\nhope someone can help me with this…\n\n\n \n微信截图_20200612143132\n788×219 16.5 KB",
