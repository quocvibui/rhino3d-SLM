  "title": "Python : hide layers in detail and zoom to remaining objects",
  "question": "Hallo, I´m trying to write a function in python that hides all layers in a detail but some and zoom the detail to extend in the remaining objects. Since I do not find any method in rhinoscriptsyntax and am not really fond of rhinocommand, I am trying using rs.Command(), unsuccesfully. What am I doing wrong?\n\n\n\n\ndef detailLayersVisibile(detail_id,layers):\n\n# select detail\n\nrs.UnselectAllObjects()\n\nrs.SelectObject(detail_id)\n\nrs.Command('-Detail Enable ', echo=False)\n\nrs.UnselectAllObjects()\n\n\n#all layers in doc\nL_all = rs.LayerNames()\n\n#cycle through layers\nfor layer in L_all:\n    if not(layer in layers):\n        commandHide = \"_HideLayersInDetail Layers \"+layer\n        rs.Command(commandHide)\n\nreturn rs.ZoomExtents()",
