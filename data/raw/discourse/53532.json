  "question": "I am new to Rhino and I have experience with Python for other developments. My question  may be due to my misunderstanding of the documentation.\n\n\nI am trying to create a point to reuse later Rhino python complains that rs.CreatePoint() does not exist in the following short program:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino #used later in the program\n\nplane_x = rs.PlaneFromPoints([0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1])\n\norigin = rs.CreatePoint(0,0,0)\n\n\n\nThanks for your help.",
