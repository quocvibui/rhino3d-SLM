  "question": "in a \nrecent thread\n i tried to combine different commands into one sequence, getting help from a windows user \n@clement\n and all worked well till i encountered this problem.\n\n\n_-Layer _Color “Hatch” 255,0,0 _Enter\n\n\nthe expected behaviour would be that the layer called Hatch becomes simply red without further questions. on Windows that seems to work, but on Mac this pops up a window with a list of options. if i omit  _Enter at the end it surpasses this window but it hooks up in the color picking pop up which seems not to know what RGB values are, entering HEX or RGB is simply ignored forcing me to pick a color manually.\n\n\n@pascal\n can you have a look? also if \n@Helvetosaur\n wants to check here again pls be invited.",
