  "question": "Hi there,\n\n\nI came accross the documentation for the method Unset\n\n\nfor example\n\n\nRhino.geometry.Rectangle3d.Unset\n\n\nhttps://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/P_Rhino_Geometry_Plane_Unset.htm\n\n\nand I don’t quite understand what it exactly does I tried a print test the output was a rhino geometry rectangle.I am curious to know where this can be used?",
