  "title": "CMM Coordinates to Model",
  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nI’m rebuilding a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) and trying to figure out a reasonable way to get from discrete coordinates from the machine to a model in Rhino. My naive approach was to draw a sphere at each coordinate received from the machine that matches the diameter of the probe tip and draw surfaces tangent to the spheres. I almost have planes working, but I’ve only managed to get Rhino to draw them through the center of the sphere rather than tangent to it, it can probably be fixed by offsetting the plane by the radius of the sphere.\n\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for cylindrical features? And/or a cleaner process in general?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n-Paul",
