  "title": "GH.Python Moving Breps with RhinoCommon returns Booleans, not geometries",
  "question": "Hi Forum,\n\n\nTrying to develop my first GH Python Script and hitting a bit of a learning curve.\n\nWatched all the Lynda training a couple of times but struggling to make my own thing work.\n\n\nThe first step of my script is to move inputted Breps.\n\nFor the next steps in my script, I need this to be a loop and use RhinoCommon (not RhinoScriptSyntax)\n\nThis is what I wrote this far:\n\n\n# Move up Test\n# geo is a bunch of spheres inputted in the component\n\nmovedGeo = []\n\nfor i in geo:\n\n    vec = rg.Transform.Translation(0,0,100)\n    x = i.Transform(vec)\n    movedGeo.append(x)\n\na = movedGeo\n\n\n\nFor some reason, this outputs a list of Booleans, all true, instead of the moved up Breps and I dont understand why.\n\n\nCould someone explain this and tell me how to get my moved up Breps instead ?\n\n\n(Ultimately my script would jiggle a bunch of breps to overcome failing boolean unions but thats as story for another time)\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n01 Moving Outputs Booleans.3dm\n (1.5 MB) \n01 Moving Outputs Booleans.gh\n (4.8 KB) \n\n\n01%20Moving%20Outputs%20Booleans\n1320×757 71.6 KB",
