  "question": "Hi All,\n\n\nIs there a way to prompt for the average of the objects with the move command? I’m trying to automate via python and want to achieve this for selected objects:\n\n\nRhino.RhinoApp.RunScript(“_selall \" “_move” “average of objects” “2000,2000,20” \" Enter”, False)\n\n\nNote the “average of objects” is a mouse command. Is there a means to select a point in the objects / middle of objects or equivalent?\n\n\nThanks",
