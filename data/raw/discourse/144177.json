  "question": "Hi all!\n\n\nI am starting with Rhino.Python to develop programming and scripting skills and since I have zero knowledge of written programming (i have only worked with grasshopper’s visual programming) I have delved into the RhinoDeveloper Rhino.Python 101 as it seemed the best way to learn it.\n\n\nI dont know if things have changed a lot (or if i am the first one to use these guides), but i couldn’t get the script from the bottom of \n2. Python Essentials\n to work.\n\n\nIt seems to fail when using _SelName inside the sweep1 command, as it props a window. I added a hyphen before every SelName to fix it.\n\n\nJust wanted to let it be known so someone could change it and no more newbies like me would think they couldnt script with python even by copy pasting code \n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\nNonworking code\n2016×2290 498 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking\n1569×1345 178 KB\n\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nI can’t even run the next chapter’s \n4.4.1 a simple function\n script and get the results shown in the guide by copy pasting and since i am taking this guide to learn from zero, i cannot guess if it is due to python changing or what.\n\n\nI mean, what does the last  mean?\n\n\n\n\nSimple function\n1026×974 115 KB",
