  "title": "ScriptEditor and GH python component randomly fail to import numpy",
  "question": "I’m working on a python script in a GH component.\n\n\nWhen I run the typical:\n\n\n# r: numpy\n\nimport numpy\n\n\n\nI sometimes get the following error message :\n\n“Error Importing Numpy: you should not try to import numpy from its source directory;  please exit the numpy source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter from there.”\n\n\nThe only resolution I’ve found so far is to manually remove all numpy related files from the .rhinocode directory.  They are then reinstalled with the “# r:” method the next time I run the script.\n\nThen, everything works for a few days, and then the message reappears.\n\nThe error occurs both in GH and in ScriptEditor\n\n\nTo call this issue aggravating is an understatement.\n\nIs there a fix I don’t know about?\n\nIs there any reason this should happen spontaneously?",
