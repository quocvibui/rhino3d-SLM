  "title": "ScriptEditor (Python 3) quick questions",
  "question": "For being able to use accented characters (utf-8) in Python 2.7 we needed to put this at the top:\n\n\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*\n\n\n\nIs this still valid for Python 3?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo scroll bar on the right hand side of the editor window?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think someone already asked about script search paths - I already set mine in the EditPythonScript editor and this seems to work for toolbar buttons with paths to run scripts.  There does not seem to be an option for this in ScriptEditor (yet) but I guess if one can set them in EditPythonScript it’s not critical?",
