  "title": "Wish: Restore the active viewport to its original state",
  "question": "While “Shift + Ctrl + dragging with the mouse” rotates an ortographic viewport, I’m unable to restore the original state of the viewport without the \n'_4View\n or \n'_4View ZEA\n commands (assuming I don’t want to delete all the viewport manipulation history be pressing or holding the Home key).\n\nWhat if pressing “Shift + Ctrl + 0” is used to restore the active viewport to its original state, while pressing the Home key returns to the last state and the viewport manipulation history is still there? Is there a way to do that already?",
