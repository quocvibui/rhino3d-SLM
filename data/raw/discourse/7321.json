  "question": "Hi,\n\nV4\n\nI am working over a raster plan image and at times wish to just view the plan as my workings are getting in the way !\n\nI wish to temporarily in a quick toggle on/off sort of way, turn off visibilty for the other layers \nTHAT ARE CURRENTLY ON\n, I dont want to find when I turn them back on that all layers turn on. I just want to toggle on/off all visible layers except for a selected layer, that selected layer being my plan image.\n\n\nHow is that done ?\n\n\nI presume I would have to click on the raster image layer to let Rhino know what I wanted to remain on !\n\nIf the procedure is different then I shall go with that, but selecting the layer I still want on seems sensible and easy !\n\n\nSteve",
