  "title": "IronPython 2 vs Python 3 Print Terminal",
  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nI am curious if there is a way to get the Terminal view of a print function to show the same data between IronPython 2 and Python 3.\n\n\nIronPython vs Python 3\n1881×956 231 KB\n\n\nI use the \nghpythonlib.components\n library frequently, and I check my work through the \nprint()\n function. However, in Python 3 the result in the Terminal is \nIronPython.Runtime.List\n\n\nI can view the opaque list easily enough if I add an extra line: \ndiv_list = [i for i in div]\n\nBut I was hoping there was a way to change this so when I \nprint()\n I can see what my data is.\n\n\nThanks!",
