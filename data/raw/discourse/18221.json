  "title": "Polyline BreakAtAngles method not working in Python?",
  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nI try using BreakAtAngles on a Rhino.Geometry.Polyline object made of segments aligned on X and then Y direction and the method BreakAtAngles is not returning the two sub-polylines that I would be expecting (returns the original polyline instead).\n\n\nHere is what I tried:\n\n\n points = [Rhino.Geometry.Point3d(0,0,0), \n                Rhino.Geometry.Point3d(1,0,0), \n                Rhino.Geometry.Point3d(2,0,0), \n                Rhino.Geometry.Point3d(2,1,0), \n                Rhino.Geometry.Point3d(2,2,0)]\n    testPolyline = Rhino.Geometry.Polyline( points )\n    testSubPolylines = testPolyline.BreakAtAngles( math.radians(1) ) # 1 degree\n    # Here, testPolyline == testSubPolylines!!!\n\n\n\nP.S.:Here is the Rhino version I use: Version 5 SR11 32-bit (5.11.50226.17195, 2015-02-26)",
