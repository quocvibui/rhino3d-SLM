  "title": "Rhino WIP: Script Package Management Improvements",
  "question": "Next build of Rhino WIP includes noticable improvements to the package management system in Rhino scripting.\n\n\nHere are quick highlights, and more details are below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistent In-Script Package Specification\n\n\nWhy: Because readability counts.\n\n\nformat\n900×109 10.9 KB\n\n\nAll scripting languages now support specifying packages in this format. Directives starts with \n# r\n and includes package provider and package specification inside double quotation markes (\n\"\n) formatted as \nprovider: specification\n as shown above.\n\n\nPackage specifications format is based on package provider format requirements. For example you can use \npip install\n arguments like \n--editable\n or \n--index-url\n when using \npip\n package provider, or list packages with version requirements like \nnumpy>=1.23\n just like when using \npip\n.\n\n\nExamples are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Install Package Dialog\n\n\nWhy: Because this dialog in Rhino 8 is not very intuitive. It does not have search for packages or dynamically linked libraries (dlls), and is not clear that .rhp and .gha files can also be referenced. It also did not have support for using libraries from yak packages and there are loads of good tools in yak plugins.\n\n\n\n\nSupports Yak packages\n\n\nSupports absolute and relative paths both in Rhino and in Grasshopper script editors\n\n\nImproved dll, rhp, and gha search and referencing.\n\n\n\n\n See below for details\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIP Improvements\n\n\nWhy: Because Rhino 8 does not have support for installing packages from custom indices, or VCS links and there are loads of good packages that come from custom sources for example \ntorch\n with CUDA support. PEP723 is also getting popular and make sense to support that for users that may want to use more modern packages managers like \nuv\n\n\n\n\nSupport for installing from VCS urls e.g. \ngit+http//...\n\n\nSupports \n--index-url\n\n\nSupports \n--find-links\n\n\nSupports \n--editable\n\n\nSupports \nPEP723\n dependencies format.\n\n\n\n\n See below for details\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Install Package Dialog\n\n\nAll packa...",
