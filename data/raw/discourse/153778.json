  "title": "How can I access special options of a grasshopper components in python?",
  "question": "I’m using the “ghpythonlib.components” in python and I’m having trouble accessing special options accessed through right-clicking grasshopper components in ghpython. How would I do that?\n\n\nFor example, the Bounding Box component in grasshopper has “Per Object” & “Union” options which can be switched by right-clicking and selecting in the context menu. Many grasshopper plugins have similar interfaces and when I try to use those components by importing “ghpythonlib.components” and calling those functions, it defaults to the initial option. Any way to change this when writing it in code so I can access the suboptions?\n\n\n\n\nimage\n1169×419 39.2 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n753×335 9.96 KB",
