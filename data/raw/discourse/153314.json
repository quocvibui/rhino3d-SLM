  "question": "Is there a way to control what view is showing in the viewport in the grasshopper python environment?\n\n\n\n\nimage\n623×964 48.7 KB\n\n\n\n\nThe reason I ask this question is I am trying to see if I can achieve a batch view snapshot capture. After some research in the forums, I found there are some previous discussions but the bar is too high and is not very user friendly.\n\n\nHowever, I am not sure if the process in my mind is possible:\n\n\n\n\nA list of view name is given\n\n\nFind the rhino view object\n\n\nMake the view active\n\n\nCapture the view to a jpg/png file\n\n\n\n\nI get stuck at step 2, cause I can only find some precedence that help getting rhino view object in the view layout. If I have 4 view layouts, I can only get views amount those layouts.\n\n\n\n\nimage\n1655×862 20.4 KB",
