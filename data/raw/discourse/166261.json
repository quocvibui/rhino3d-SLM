  "question": "Hey guys,\n\nI am trying to get familiar with Python scripting to write my own little components. I want to slowly dive into this topic by converting this small script into a component: I have a surface, that I want to extrude by a certain height and get all edges as curves.\n\n\nBrepEdges.gh\n (4.8 KB)\n\n\nDo you have a hint for me how to tackle this?\n\nBest\n\nMax\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-09-26 at 17.40.39\n945×259 35.1 KB\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-09-26 at 17.40.37\n850×621 55.4 KB",
