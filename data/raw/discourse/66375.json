  "question": "Hello everybody,\n\n\nI’m recently interested in rhinocommon/ python for making my life easier with rhino in my everyday workflow and even if might be a simple solving for most experienced, I am asking you for at least a small advice.\n\n\nimport Rhino\nimport scriptcontext\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\nsurface = rs.GetObject(\"Select surface\", rs.filter.surface, preselect=True, select=True)\n\n\n\n\n\nat the surface selection to have the possibility to use ALT or CRTL to deselect or to select any surface (similar to _OffsetSrf),\n\n\nif no surface selected and when right click is pressed -> don’t want the script to Cancel but to print \"No surface selected to continue \" and want GetObject to repet as a loop,\n\n\nif pressing ESC during GetObject -> print “Select surface: \nESC\n”\n\n\n\n\nI have to mention that I have no coding background experience. My apologies for misunderstandings\n\n\nThank you everyone in advance for the time given\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nCI",
