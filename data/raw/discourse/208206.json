  "question": "Hi there,\n\n\nI am working on an eto-panel and I would like to link an undo to an datagrid on this panel.\n\n\nWhat I would do if I was operating on the model is this.\n\n\nuint recordSerialNumber = RhinoDoc.ActiveDoc.BeginUndoRecord(\"Delete data\");\n\n// Do stuff\n\nRhinoDoc.ActiveDoc.EndUndoRecord(recordSerialNumber);\n\n\n\nAs I am deleting stuff from a datagrid I suppose this is not working, right?\n\nDoes anybody have experience with this?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nT.",
