Spaces represent smaller units than HB-Rooms and \ncan be made up of one or more individual volumes. This is useful if you are calculating \ninterior net-floor-area or volume as in the Passive House models. Each Space will map to \na single entry in the WUFI 'Ventilation Rooms' or a PHPP 'Additional Ventilation'.\n-\nEM November 1, 2023\n    Args:\n        _spaces: (list[Space]) A list of the new PH-Spaces to add to the Honeybee-Rooms.\n        \n        _offset_dist_: (float) Default=0.1 An optional value to offset the 'test points' being \n            used to determine the right honeybee-Room to host the space in. This value \n            will be used to move the test point 'up' (world Z) by some dimension before \n            testing if it is 'inside' the honeybee-Room. This is useful you drew your\n            floor-segments directly 'on' the floor surface of the honeybee room as this \n            sometimes leads to errors when testing for 'inside'.\n        \n        inherit_room_names_ (bool): default=False. Set to true if you would like all of the \n            PH-Spaces 'in' a Honeybee Room to automatically inherit the display name of the \n            Honeybee Room. Note: this will override any user-defined Space names.\n        \n        _hb_rooms: (list[Room]) The list of honeybee-Rooms to add to the spaces to.\n            \n    Returns:\n        check_pts_: A preview of the test points being used to evaluate the right\n            honeybee-Room to use for the host of the space. Useful for debugging \n            if you run into hosting problems.\n            \n        hb_rooms_: The honeyee-Rooms with the PH Spaces added to them.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport scriptcontext as sc\nimport Rhino as rh\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport ghpythonlib.components as ghc\nimport Grasshopper as gh\n\nfrom honeybee_ph_rhino import gh_compo_io, gh_io\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_\nreload(honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_)\nghenv.Component.Name = \"HBPH - Add Spaces\"\nDEV = honeybee_ph_rhino._component_info_.set_component_params(ghenv, dev=False)\nif DEV:\n    from honeybee_ph_rhino.make_spaces import make_space\n    reload(make_space)\n    from honeybee_ph_rhino.gh_compo_io import space_add_spc as gh_compo_io\n    reload(gh_compo_io)\n    reload(gh_io)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# -- GH Interface\nIGH = gh_io.IGH( ghdoc, ghenv, sc, rh, rs, ghc, gh )\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ngh_compo_interface = gh_compo_io.GHCompo_AddPHSpaces(\n    IGH,\n    _spaces,\n    _offset_dist_,\n    inherit_room_names_,\n    _hb_rooms,\n    )\nhb_rooms_, check_pts_, open_rooms_ = gh_compo_interface.run()",
