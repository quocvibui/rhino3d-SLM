  "title": "Rhino scripting or Python for this?",
  "question": "Hi\n\n\nI have been using Macro commands and I´m very happy with it´s simplicity, BUT I guess it has it´s limitations.\n\nI have several points in my file and I want to run the command “EvaluatePt” to place the coodinates on screen of every point I have selected.\n\n\nI think I would prefer to try Python since I belive it will allow me to do more stuff, but I´m receptive to Rhino scripting.\n\nWhat ever works is fine.\n\n\nThanks a lot.",
