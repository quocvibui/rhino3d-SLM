  "title": "[Update] ScriptParasite 2: Compatibility with Rhino 8 script editors",
  "question": "Hi all,\n\n\nI’ve just released a new version of ScriptParasite 2, that can connect to the newer C# and now also Python components. It’s currently available through the package manager as ScriptParasite 2, and obviously, only available for Rhino 8.\n\n\nThis allows you 2-way synchronisation between Rhino and more capable editors such as VSCode, Rider, Visual studio, to do quick prototyping with scripts, and allow easier access to functions such as code completion, AI editting and similar things.\n\n\nimage\n479×658 24.3 KB\n\n\nThe script parasite for the older versions also remains available as a seperate package.\n\n\nIt’s also available on food4rhino, but with the current requirements for differing builds and .net framework/.net core situations I highly recommend using the package manager over manually installing this.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n\nIt should be compatible with Rhino for Mac, but I do not own a mac, so I have no way of really testing this. Python support seems to work pretty well as well, but as I do not use python that much, I can’t really tell if this will work.\n\n\nLet me know what you think!",
