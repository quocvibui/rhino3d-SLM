  "question": "Dear \n@stevebaer\n (I think you re the right person ?)\n\nthe new documentation / webpage still has some limitations / aspects I do not like.\n\n(Mac os X, Safari)\n\n\ncollapsing not working (bug?)\n\n\ncurrently (mac os x safari) collapsing / expanding is not working in the main section / window:\n\nmouse over on \nConstructors (5)\n in this case shows a mouse-pointer change to a hand-symbol.\n\nBut no action on click.\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.03.46\n1824×1256 321 KB\n\nExpanding / collapsing on the left tree-view works.\n\n\ncollapsing / expanding for enums\n\n\nThis bug is extremely annoying for enums:\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.07.10\n1814×1286 294 KB\n\nI would suggest that enums values should be expanded by default.\n\n\nType-Parameters\n\n\n… should be interactive as well.\n\nFor example in this case I would expect “<BrepLoop”> to be a link.\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.10.28\n1180×788 52.3 KB\n\n\nReadability\n\n\nMaybe I am not used to the new layout - but especially for Functions with multiple Signatures / Parameter Settings the readability should be improved.\n\nI also think, that the inconsistency of links for types (some types are link, blue, underlined, some are grayed out not linked, ) limits the ability to get a fast overview.\n\nThis is the same for the initial definition - this array might get a very light background color.\n\nAs it is for the parameter-Details.\n\n\nI don’ t think the full Namespace / path “Rhino.Geometry.Point3d” is necessary.\n\nIf someone needs this info, the link will show it.\n\na single Word would increase readability.\n\n\nScreenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.19.44\n1378×1756 360 KB\n\n\nLayout\n\n\nI think the overall Layout still has some potential to be easier to read and be more pleasant / readable…\n\n\nhopefully this is some work in progress and we ll see some improvements.\n\nThanks for your effort.\n\n\nPlease keep the link to the old webpage as long as there are these kind of issues.\n\n\nkind regards -tom",
