  "question": "Hi!\n\n\nWe currently review our models intern with (numbered) dots and corresponding notes (1. remark A, 2. remark B, etc) in the notes panel.\n\n\nTo register and track the history of the reviewing, we have to work with copy/past to excel.\n\n\nIs there a way to either work with UserText on the dots or maybe a panel with listed dot info?\n\nI can imagine someone already implement this function or created a workaround for this important process.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nThomas",
