  "title": "Using PyCharm for editing RhinoPython",
  "question": "PyCharm from JetBrains is one of the most powerful IDE for python, and i don’t think Rhino development team need to put a lot of recourse to make EditPythonScript as good as PyCharm or other IDEs.\n\n\nSo i try to use PyCharm for editing python for rhino, but i don’t know how to make PyCharm understand the RhinoPython module structure. (i.e. after i type “rs”, no hints of method appear, and “import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs” is shown with error)\n\n\nDo anyone try to use PyCharm for editing before? If so, can you share how you make PyCharm understand the modules of RhinoPython?\n\n\nThx!!",
