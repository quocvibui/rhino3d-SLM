  "question": "Hi!\n\nThis post is directly related to \nthis one\n but it didn’t get answers.\n\nI have three questions concerning the way the logs work on compute:\n\n\n\n\nIs there a way to find these logs for the distant server? They appear in the command prompt window on local server but i can’t seem to find the right logs folder.\n\n\nI have a few examples where components have a different behaviour whether they are run with the GH GUI or on a compute server (even local). Is this a known issue?\n\n\nIs there a way to make the errors that appear in red non blocking the way it is with the GUI? In the GUI when i have a red error it just blocks the downstream but what’s non dependant on the component still runs, on compute it just blocks the whole process: is there a way to change that in the parameters?\n\n\n\n\nred_error\n1102×815 59.8 KB\n\n\nThanks in advance, best\n\n\n\n\n[NOTA] First point was solved, please find solution on \noriginal post",
