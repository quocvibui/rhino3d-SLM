  "title": "Creating a mesh object via GUID",
  "question": "I was wondering if someone could clear up something conceptually for me. I have been scripting in Rhino for a while via python but strictly within the rhinoscriptsyntax space. When venturing into the Rhino namespace I have a hard time getting things done. I assume its because its based off of C++ methodology and I havent studied that before. Anyways, I am trying to perform a quadremesh via Rhino.Geometry.SubD.CreateFromMesh(mesh). I can get it to work when I explicitly prompt the user to select a mesh. But lets say I have multiple meshs withing a file, but all named differently. Normally what I would do is create a list with rs.allobjects(), then loop threw and see which object has a matching name with an if statement and rs.objectname. But that gets me the GUID not the mesh object itself. How would I go about doing that ?\n\n\nThanks",
