  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI have a file with multiple layers and I want all of these to become children of new layer I am creating, is there a way to do this with rhinoscriptsyntax? It seems you can check if they have children or parent layers but not a way to set these.\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nVincenzo",
