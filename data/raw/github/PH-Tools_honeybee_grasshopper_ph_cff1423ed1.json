As stated on that component:\n---\n\"Note that NO REFLECTIONS OF SOLAR ENERGY ARE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS\nPERFORMED BY THIS COMPONENT and it is important to bear in mind that vertical\nsurfaces typically receive 20% - 30% of their solar energy from reflection off\nof the ground. Also note that this component uses the CAD environment's ray\nintersection methods, which can be fast for geometries with low complexity\nbut does not scale well for complex geometries or many test points. For such\ncomplex cases and situations where relfection of solar energy are important,\nhoneybee-radiance should be used.\"\n-\nEM February 11, 2025\n    Args:\n        _setttings: The Settings to use for the shading calculations.
