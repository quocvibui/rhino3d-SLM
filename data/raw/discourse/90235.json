  "title": "Memorize objects for easily finding in a later command/session?",
  "question": "If I have a file with 500 objects, and I use a command to set the Attribute user text of 15 objects. Is there a way to store the guid’s of those objects somewhere within the file so that I can access them easily in a later stage?\n\nLet’s say I in a new rhino session want to set attribute user texts to other objects, is there a way that I can immediately call a group of guid’s (which I created earlier) and lock them without having to loop through all objects and check if they have attribute user text?\n\nI was thinking of creating a reference layer with point objects that contain different attribute user texts with all the GUID’s written in there but I’m thinking there must be a built-in way of doing this?",
