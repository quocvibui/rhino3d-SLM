  "title": "V6 rs.LayerVisible() not undoable",
  "question": "Just open a new file from one of the standard templates and then run the following from the script editor:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nrs.LayerVisible(\"Layer 01\",False)\nrs.LayerVisible(\"Layer 03\",False)\n\n\n\nThat should turn off Layer 01 and Layer 03.  Now hit the Undo button or Ctrl+Z.  It says “Undoing EditPythonscript”, but the layers don’t turn back on.\n\n\nIn V5, the same script responds correctly to Undo, the layers become visible again.\n\n\nI didn’t see a youtrack item for this, but maybe I missed it.\n\n\n–Mitch",
