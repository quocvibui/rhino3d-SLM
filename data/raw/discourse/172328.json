  "title": "Connect VSCode to Rhino/Grasshopper",
  "question": "Hello there!\n\n\nFor our teaching course \nAR-327\n here at EPFL we developed for our students a tiny Rhino plug-in to run C# and Python scripts (both CPython and IronPython) from VSCode directly into Rhino.\n\n\nWe loved the new editor in V8 and we are super grateful to have it but we also let our students experience an external IDE with all its advantages, notably AI-assisted coding (Copilot, Bito, Tabnine, etc). There were few VSCode-Rhino connectors but they couldn’t run C# and CPython, nevertheless they’ve been a great source of inspiration. Anyhow, here’s a simplified version: \nscript-sync\n .\n\n\nWe made it free and open. Hope it might be useful to someone! Cheers🌲\n\n\n \nVSCode\n: \nscript-sync - Visual Studio Marketplace\n\n\n \nPackage manager\n: “script-sync”\n\n\n \nGitHub\n: \nGitHub - ibois-epfl/script-sync: Rhino/Grasshopper/VSCode plug-in to run C# and Python (IronPython or CPython) scripts directly from VSCode.",
