  "title": "When split brep fails, what to use to split and Untrimmed Surface?",
  "question": "So I’m trying to split an untrimmed surface with a plane, I created a Plane Srf and use it on the Split Brep. Sometimes this fails and the surfaces doesn’t split which kills everything else down the line.\n\n\nIs there anything more stable to Split/Trim a surface with a plane?\n\n\nI tried in python but didn’t had much luck\n\n\nRhino.Geometry.Brep.Split(B,C,0.001)\n\n\n\nSplit fails, returns nothing.\n\n\nRhino.Geometry.Surface.Split(\n\n\n\nNeeds a parameter as a float, but I can’t find any information about parameters and how to get it.\n\n\nRhino.Geometry.BrepFace.Split(\n\n\nwhich uses a curve to trim, but I can’t convert a surface into a brepface\n\n\nRhino.Geometry.Surface.Trim(\n\n\nHow do I get the U V intervals of the plane, and will it work if the plane is not in the direction of the U V of the surface?\n\n\nAny help would be great.\n\nThank you",
