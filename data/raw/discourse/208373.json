  "title": "Question regarding dockable panel from python/ETO",
  "question": "I would like to create a dockable panel, that can be docked to the right side panel, with an interface similar to the top part of the Materials/Environments/Textures panels (that is to say, a section with a grid/list/tree view where items can be added and an action gets executed when clicking on the items, like seen below).  Can this be done with python/ETO? Is there an example of such an interface I can work on?\n\n\nrhino-panel-texture\n246×240 9.26 KB",
