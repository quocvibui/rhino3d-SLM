  "title": "Help with GHPython treehelper needed",
  "question": "Hi,\n\n\nI need your help regarding accessing items from a tree using GHPython. Please see attached image:\n\n\n\n\ntreehelper_1\n1027×816 75.5 KB\n\n\n\n\nHere is the corresponding GH file:\n\n\ntreehelper_1.gh\n (7.2 KB)\n\n\n1.)\n\nWhat is the correct way to access the individual elements (like the green marked 11.4 in this example)? I tried tree_to_list from treehelpers, but for some reason, although I can access the {0;x} elements, I cannot access the {1;x} elements.\n\n\nShoould be really easy… for someone who knows how to do it.\n\n\n2.)\n\nHow can I check programmatically that there is {0;x} and {1;x} but no {2;x} ?\n\n\n3.)\n\nIs there an article / video you could recommend to better understand the topic? I already watched some videos about data trees, but when it comes to the details, I am still lost. \n\n\nThank you for your support.",
