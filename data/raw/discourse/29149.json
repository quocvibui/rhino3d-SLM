  "title": "Set transparency for objects individually",
  "question": "Lets say I have a complex closed polysrf that defines a region and I want to manipulate/move objects within it while making sure that the objects stay within the region. Is there any way to ghost out closed polysrf so that it is still there as a reference, but transparent enough to see through it (so I can see and select the objects). It is also preferable that when I click on an object that the region is not possible to select, since I don’t want to deal with the selection menu every time I select the objects.\n\n\nI know there is a transparency option in the display options, but I don’t want everything to be transparent.\n\n\nI know that I could apply a transparent material, but I’m looking for something closer to the hide/unhide function.",
