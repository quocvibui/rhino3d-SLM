  "question": "I am trying to write a Python script that converts a vector to a polar angle on my current Cplane. For example:\n\n\n[1,0,0] = 0°\n\n[0,1,0] = 90°\n\n[-1,0,0] = 180°\n\n[0,-1,0] = 270° (or -90° would work too)\n\n\nwhat would be the easiest way to accomplish this with a known vector?",
