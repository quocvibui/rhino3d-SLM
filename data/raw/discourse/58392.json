  "question": "I try to get BrepLoops.To3dCurves without curves with are overlapping completly.\n\n\nAs example i have this image:\n\n\n\n\nukahviui.png\n1920×1080\n\n\n\n\nI have Brep “1” and with BrepLoops.To3dCurves i get “2” but i like to get “3”.\n\nThe curve i have removed in “3” are 2 Curves overlapping complet but are part of the same curve as “2”.\n\n\nHow could i get “3” with RhinoCommon and python?",
