  "title": "Problem with CreateSoftEditSurface parameters",
  "question": "I am having trouble making the CreateSoftEditSurface method change a surface.  I think the parameters are correct, but the surface is not moving.  There isn’t any error messages.\n\n\nHere is the test script that I am working on:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\nimport Rhino\n\nsurfaceGUID = rs.GetObject('Pick the surface to soft edit...', rs.filter.surface)\npointOnSurface = rs.GetPointOnSurface(surfaceGUID, 'Pick point on the surface to edit...')\n \n# List of U and V parameters at the point\nUV = rs.SurfaceClosestPoint(surfaceGUID, pointOnSurface)\nP2d = rs.coerce2dpoint(UV)\n \n# Surface normal at the point (should be a unit vector)\nN  = rs.SurfaceNormal(surfaceGUID, UV)\n \n# Move 6 units in the surface normal direction\nMove = rs.VectorScale(N, 6)\n \n# Get the current \"model absolute tolerance\"\nTol = Rhino.RhinoDoc.ActiveDoc.ModelAbsoluteTolerance\n \nSurf = rs.coercesurface(surfaceGUID)\n \nSO = Rhino.Geometry.Surface.CreateSoftEditSurface(Surf, P2d, Move, 2, 2, Tol, False)\n\n\n\nCould somebody please let me know what I am doing wrong?\n\n\nThanks for your time.",
