  "title": "Why do I get \"traceback\" error?",
  "question": "I called GHpython in grasshopper and copied this example code that got from a website and copied it into the editor. I did do the same with similar code, and received the same message of error in the last line that both were similar (one was “AddPoint” and another “Addcircle”).\n\n\nI thought it was because of the difference in Python versions, so I deleted those parentheses but received another error about “AddPoint” or AddCilrcle.\n\n\nWhat is the problem and how can I resolve that?\n\n\nOf course I had to add \" Class A\" to the code by myself  due to receiving a message of error initially.\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\n\n\n\nscript\n849×625 71.8 KB",
