  "title": "Soft Edit Surface uv Type Hint?",
  "question": "Hello,\n\n\nIn Grasshopper, I want to soft edit a NURBS surface via Python: SoftEditSurface. My problem is that Python expects the type Point2d as uv input, but in Type Hints I find only Point3d.\n\n\nI tried every variant (at least I think so) but to no avail. I’m am pretty new to using Python in GH so I may have missed something essential anyway.\n\n\nAny hints are highly welcome.\n\n\nCheers, Horst\n\n\nSoftEditSurface_Python_280120.gh\n (20.4 KB)",
