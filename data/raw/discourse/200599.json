  "title": "Retrieving material Notes from material with python",
  "question": "There is a Notes field on each material, accessible through the UI. I am trying to access it in code and have tried various approaches, none of which work.\n\nIn a simple world this would be something like material.Notes, similar to material.Name. Clearly this doesn’t work and I’m hoping there is a simple way to access this notes field.",
