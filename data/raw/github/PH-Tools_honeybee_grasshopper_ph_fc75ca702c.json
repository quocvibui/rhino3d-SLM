This is used\nprimarily for WUFI-Passive which has a separate input for dedicated exhaust equipment \nsuch as that used for Kitchens, Dryers and other typical uses.\n-\nNOTE: Using the component will add ONLY the Passive House devices and will **NOT** add \nany components to the HB-Energy model. If you need to model mechancial equipment for an EnergyPlus\n/ OpenStudio simulation then you must also use the Honeybee-Energy / IronBug components to setup\nthose devices separate from the inputs defined on the component here.\n-\nEM April 21, 2024\n    Args:\n        _exhaust_vent_devices: (List[_ExhaustVentilatorBase]) A list of the Exhaust \n            Ventilator objects that you would like to add to the Honeybee-rooms.\n\n        _hb_rooms: (List[room.Room]): A list of the rooms to add the Exhaust Ventilator\n            to.
