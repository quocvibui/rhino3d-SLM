  "title": "Returns / Using MessageBox (Rhino Python)",
  "question": "Hey to all,\n\n.\n\nI am writing a script using Python in Rhino and I would like to use the MessageBox with two buttons: “YES” and “NO”.\n\nI know how to get this box:\n\n.\n\nrs.MessageBox(’’‘Orientierung des Rumpfes ok?\n\nx=L / y=B / z=D’’’, 4)\n\n.\n\n… but how can I use the returns?\n\nI know that “YES” has the value 6 and “NO” has the value 7 … but that’s all I know \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMy script creates waterlines on a ship hull, and I would like the user to check this generated lines.\n\nIf the lines are ok, he (or she) can select the “YES”-button and the script continues with more lines (frames, etc).\n\n.\n\nIf the waterlines aren’t correct, he (or she) can select “NO” … I would like the script to stop at this point, so that the user has the chance to correct the wrong lines; after that, he should type “continue” or something like that and it would be great if the script continues then.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI know, two questions in one post aren’t ideal …\n\nBut I hope that someone knows a way to solve one of my problems!\n\n.\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\nPhil",
