  "question": "Hi\n\nI have a list of UnTrimmed Surfaces which are a part of a Pyramid Geometry, I want to extract the intersections for all of the surfaces and trim all the extra parts except “Solid Difference” parts.\n\nin another way, at the end I want to have Some surfaces like the picture below:\n\n\n\n\nIntersections Sample\n784×573 121 KB\n\n\n\n\nI know in Rhino, I can Use the “Intersect” Command simply and trim or split the surfaces with the curves extracted from that command. But in ghpython in Grasshopper, I can’t figure it out!\n\nI wrote some script for that but the output is null and I don’t know whats wrong with it. I wonder if someone can solve the issue.\n\nthanks.\n\n\n\n\narray Curve\n1278×1034 42.8 KB\n\n\n\n\nintersect command in rhino.3dm\n (198.9 KB)\n\n\n\n\nintersect command in rhino\n880×811 163 KB\n\n\n\n\nSurfaceList Intersections.gh\n (39.8 KB)",
