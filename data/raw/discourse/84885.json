  "title": "How to check if a group has been deleted?",
  "question": "I’m using \nsc.doc.ActiveDoc.Groups\n to get the group table.\n\n\nthen I want to check if the user has deleted a group, but:\n\n\nsc.doc.ActiveDoc.Groups.IsDeleted(sc.doc.ActiveDoc.Groups.Find(group.Name))\n\n\nwill not mark the groups as deleted, unless I purge the groups.\n\n\nIs there another way to do this?\n\n\nEventually my goal is to add numbered groups to the document, but if the user deletes or undo the operation, I want this to affect my counter. So the idea is to get the list of groups and check the numbers if there is a free ‘slot’. For example: if user adds 3 groups and deletes nr. 2, the next number should 2 instead of 4",
