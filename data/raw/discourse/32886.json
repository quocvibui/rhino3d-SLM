  "question": "Hey guys, new to Rhino, and running into an issue straight away, been playing around for a while but jsut can;'t seem to get around it,\n\n\nI need to do a batch script to convert a set of files,\n\ni have got the folder indexed, I can get all the filenames etc, thats all fine, (I’m familiar with python)\n\n\nhowever when I try to open the file through script Rhino always prompts me whether I want to save, and there is something about UpdatePromtUpdateBox etc. which means my file never loads (and even if it would, it does this for every file requiring manual clicking,\n\n\nI also found a ready made batch convert but it does the same thing.\n\n\nanyways the most basic thing to test seemed to be this:\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\n\npath  = ‘Y/:test.stp’\n\n\nrs.Command('_-Open ’ + path)\n\n\nmany thanks for all help\n\n\nedit:\n\n\ntried some other stuff like\n\n\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\n\nrs.DocumentModified(False)\n\nrs.Command(“_-Open ““Y/:test.stp”” _Enter”, 0)\n\n\nor\n\n\nrs.Command(“_-Open \" & “Y/:test.stp” & \" _Enter”, 0)\n\n\nstill no avail",
