  "question": "It seems like we are unable to access the code inside of a component using the new python components:\n\n\nRhinoCodePluginGH.Components.Python3Component\n\n\nRhinoCodePluginGH.Components.IronPython2Component\n\nWhereas it was previously a property in the old Python component:\n\n\nGhPython.Component.ZuiPythonComponent\n\n\nimage\n963×878 47.7 KB\n\n\nIs there another way to currently to access the component code? It would be awesome to have the Code property again",
