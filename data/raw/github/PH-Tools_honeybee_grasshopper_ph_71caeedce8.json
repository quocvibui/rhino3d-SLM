This system can serve one or more Honeybee Rooms \nusing the 'Apply SHW System' component. \n-\nNOTE: Each unique device in the system will only be added ONCE to the PHPP or \nWUFI-Passive model, regardless of how many rooms the System is applied to. If each room needs\nto have its own equipment, build devices for each room separately.\n-\nNOTE: Using the component will add ONLY the Passive House devices and will **NOT** add \nany components to the HB-Energy model. If you need to model mechancial equipment for an EnergyPlus\n/ OpenStudio simulation then you must also use the Honeybee-Energy / IronBug components to setup\nthose devices separate from the inputs defined on the component here.\n-\nEM April 21, 2024\n\n    Args:\n        \n        _name_: [str] Text to set the name for the PhHotWaterSystem and to be\n            incorporated into unique system identifier.
