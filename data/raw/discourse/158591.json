  "title": "SelectionFilterSettings problem",
  "question": "Hi \n@dale\n,\n\n\ni have a command which requires to temporarily enable sub object selection by enabling the \nSelectionFilterSettings.SubObjectSelect\n property to \nTrue\n. As soon as i enable my own \ntmp_settings\n using:\n\n\n\n\nSelectionFilterSettings.UpdateFromState(tmp_settings)\n\n\n\n\nthe Selection Filter panel pops up. I want to control this, preferrably it should not pop up at all. I’m aware that i can close it after my command finished by scripting it:\n\n\nrs.Command(\"! _SelectionFilter\", False)\n\n\nbut this would close it if a user had it open, either docked or floating before running my command. Is there a way to access this panel and check if it was visible before my command has been started ? Or is there a way to prevent it popping up ?\n\n\nthanks,\n\nc.",
