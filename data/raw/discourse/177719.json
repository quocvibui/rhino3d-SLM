  "title": "Export 3mf File with Attributes",
  "question": "Hello\n\n\nI am playing with 3mf filetype export. My goal is to export a mesh with custom attributes attached(not a separate .csv file). There is a nice export dialog window in Rhino, but I was not able to get any information back when re-importing previously exported 3mf object. There are only few information about 3mf file on the forum, so I would like to ask someone for help.\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use 3mf export fields for some custom additional information (e.g. string with parameters from GH)?\n\n\nIs it possible to re-import 3mf file into Rhino with all additional information attached?\n\n\n\n\nThank you",
